PREFACE
</h2>

<p class="indent">
In attempting to get what is little less than a history of the world,
from a special point of view, into a couple of hundred duodecimo
pages, I have had to make three bites at my very big cherry. In the
Appendix I have given in chronological order, and for the first
time on such a scale in English, the chief voyages and explorations
by which our knowledge of the world has been increased, and the
chief works in which that knowledge has been recorded. In the body
of the work I have then attempted to connect together these facts
in their more general aspects. In particular I have grouped the
great voyages of 1492-1521 round the search for the Spice Islands
as a central motive. It is possible that in tracing the Portuguese
and Spanish discoveries to the need of titillating the parched
palates of the medi&aelig;vals, who lived on salt meat during winter
and salt fish during Lent, I may have unduly simplified the problem.
But there can be no doubt of the paramount importance attached
to the spices of the East in the earlier stages. The search for
the El Dorado came afterwards, and is still urging men north to
the Yukon, south to the Cape, and in a south-easterly direction
to "Westralia."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page vi"><span class="page">Page vi</span></a>
Besides the general treatment in the text and the special details
in the Appendix, I have also attempted to tell the story once more
in a series of maps showing the gradual increase of men's knowledge
of the globe. It would have been impossible to have included all
these in a book of this size and price but for the complaisance
of several publishing firms, who have given permission for the
reproduction on a reduced scale of maps that have already been
prepared for special purposes. I have specially to thank Messrs.
Macmillan for the two dealing with the Portuguese discoveries,
and derived from Mr. Payne's excellent little work on European
Colonies; Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Co., of Boston, for several
illustrating the discovery of America, from Mr. J. Fiske's "School
History of the United States;" and Messrs. Phillips for the arms
of Del Cano, so clearly displaying the "spicy" motive of the first
circumnavigation of the globe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I have besides to thank the officials of the Royal Geographical
Society, especially Mr. Scott Keltie and Dr. H. R. Mill, for the
readiness with which they have placed the magnificent resources
of the library and map-room of that national institution at my
disposal, and the kindness with which they have answered my queries
and indicated new sources of information.

LIST OF MAPS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
</h2>

<p class="indent">
<b>Coat-of-arms of Del Cano</b> (from Guillemard, <i>Magellan</i>.
By kind permission of Messrs. Phillips).&mdash;It illustrates the
importance attributed to the Spice Islands as the main object of
Magellan's voyage. For the blazon, see pp. <a href="#page 129">129-30.</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Earliest Map of the World</b> (from the Rev. C. J. Ball's
<i>Bible Illustrations</i>, 1898).&mdash;This is probably of the
eighth century B.C., and indicates the Babylonian view of the world
surrounded by the ocean, which is indicated by the parallel circles,
and traversed by the Euphrates, which is seen meandering through
the middle, with Babylon, the great city, crossing it at the top.
Beyond the ocean are seven successive projections of land, possibly
indicating the Babylonian knowledge of surrounding countries beyond
the Euxine and the Red Sea.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The World according to Ptolemy</b>.&mdash;It will be observed
that the Greek geographer regarded the Indian Ocean as a landlocked
body of water, while he appears to have some knowledge of the so
ces of the Nile. The general tendency of the map is to extend Asia
very much to the east, which led to the miscalculation encouraging
Columbus to discover America.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Roman Roads of Europe</b> (drawn specially for this
work).&mdash;These give roughly the limits within which the inland
geographical knowledge of the ancients reach some degrees of accuracy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 10"><span class="page">Page 10</span></a>
<b>Geographical Monsters</b> (from an early edition of Mandeville's
<i>Travels</i>).&mdash;Most of the medi&aelig;val maps were dotted
over with similar monstrosities.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Hereford Map</b>.&mdash;This, one of the best known of
medi&aelig;val maps, was drawn by Richard of Aldingham about 1307.
Like most of these maps, it has the East with the terrestrial paradise
at the top, and Jerusalem is represented as the centre.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Peutinger Table, Western Part</b>.&mdash;This is the only Roman
map extant; it gives lines of roads from the eastern shores of
Britain to the Adriatic Sea. It is really a kind of bird's-eye
view taken from the African coast. The Mediterranean runs as a
thin strip through the lower part of the map. The lower section
joins on to the upper.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The World according to Ibn Haukal</b> (from Lelewel,
<i>G&eacute;ographie du mon age</i>).&mdash;This map, like most
of the Arabian maps, has the south at the top. It is practically
only a diagram, and is thus similar to the Hereford Map in general
form.&mdash;Misr=Egypt, Fars=Persia, Andalus=Spain.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Coast-line of the Mediterranean</b> (from the <i>Portulano</i> of
Dulcert, 1339, given in Nordenskiold's <i>Facsimile Atlas</i>).&mdash;To
illustrate the accuracy with which mariners' charts gave the coast-lines
as contrasted with the merely symbolical representation of other
medi&aelig;val maps.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Fra Mauro Map, 1457</b> (from Lelewel, <i>loc. Cit.</i>).&mdash;Here,
as usual, the south is placed at the top of the map. Besides the
ordinary medi&aelig;val conceptions, Fra Mauro included the Portuguese
discoveries along the coast of Africa up to his time, 1457.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Portuguese Discoveries in Africa</b> (from E. J. Payne, <i>European
Colonies</i>, 1877).&mdash;Giving the successive points reached by
the Portuguese navigators during the fifteenth century.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 11"><span class="page">Page 11</span></a>
<b>Portuguese Indies</b> (from Payne, <i>loc. Cit.</i>).&mdash;All
the ports mentioned in ordinary type were held by the Portuguese
in the sixteenth century.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Toscanelli Map</b> (from Kretschmer, <i>Entdeckung Amerikas</i>,
1892).&mdash;This is a reconstruction of the map which Columbus
got from the Italian astronomer and cartographer Toscanelli and
used to guide him in his voyage across the Atlantic. Its general
resemblance to the Behaim Globe will be remarked.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Behaim Globe</b>.&mdash;This gives the information about
the world possessed in 1492, just as Columbus was starting, and
is mainly based upon the map of Toscanelli, which served as his
guide. It will be observed that there is no other continent between
Spain and Zipangu or Japan, while the fabled islands of St. Brandan
and Antilia are represented bridging the expanse between the Azores
and Japan.
</p>

<p class="indent">

<p class="indent">
<b>Map of the World</b>, from the Ptolemy Edition of 1548 (after
Kretschmer's <i>Entdeckungsgeschichte Amerikas</i>).&mdash;It will
be observed that Mexico is supposed to be joined on to Asia, and
that the North Pacific was not even known to exist.
</p>

<p class="indent">

of Sciences in 1737, by kind permission of Messrs. Hachette). Japan
is represented as a peninsula.

by kind permission of Messrs. Hachette).&mdash;It will
<a name="page 12"><span class="page">Page 12</span></a>
be seen that the Northern and Western coasts were even by this
time tolerably well mapped out, leaving only the eastern coast to
be explored by Cook.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Australia</b>, showing routes of explorations (prepared specially
for the present volume). The names of the chief explorers are given
at the top of the map.

includes a knowledge of most of the African river sand lakes due
to the explorations of the Portuguese.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Africa</b> (made specially for this volume, to show chief
explorations and partition).&mdash;The names of the explorers are

due to Franklin expeditions and most of the searchers after the
North-West Passage.
</p>

THE STORY OF<br />
</span>
GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERY
</p>

<h2>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p class="indent">
How was the world discovered? That is to say, how did a certain
set of men who lived round the Mediterranean Sea, and had acquired
the art of recording what each generation had learned, become
successively aware of the other parts of the globe? Every part of
the earth, so far as we know, has been inhabited by man during the
five or six thousand years in which Europeans have been storing up
their knowledge, and all that time the inhabitants of each part, of
course, were acquainted with that particular part: the Kamtschatkans
knew Kamtschatka, the Greenlanders, Greenland; the various tribes of
North American Indians knew, at any rate, that part of America over
which they wandered, long before Columbus, as we say, "discovered"
it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Very often these savages not only know their own country, but can
express their knowledge in maps of very remarkable accuracy. Cortes
traversed over 1000 miles through Central
<a name="page 14"><span class="page">Page 14</span></a>
America, guided only by a calico map of a local cacique. An Eskimo
named Kalliherey drew out, from his own knowledge of the coast
between Smith Channel and Cape York, a map of it, varying only
in minute details from the Admiralty chart. A native of Tahiti,
named Tupaia, drew out for Cook a map of the Pacific, extending
over forty-five degrees of longitude (nearly 3000 miles), giving
the relative size and position of the main islands over that huge
tract of ocean. Almost all geographical discoveries by Europeans
have, in like manner, been brought about by means of guides, who
necessarily knew the country which their European masters wished
to "discover."
</p>

<p class="indent">
What, therefore, we mean by the history of geographical discovery is
the gradual bringing to the knowledge of the nations of civilisation
surrounding the Mediterranean Sea the vast tracts of land extending
in all directions from it. There are mainly two divisions of this
history&mdash;the discovery of the Old World and that of the New,
including Australia under the latter term. Though we speak of
geographical discovery, it is really the discovery of new tribes
of men that we are thinking of. It is only quite recently that
men have sought for knowledge about lands, apart from the men who
inhabit them. One might almost say that the history of geographical
discovery, properly so called, begins with Captain Cook, the motive
of whose voyages was purely scientific curiosity. But before his
time men wanted to know one another for two chief reasons: they
wanted to
<a name="page 15"><span class="page">Page 15</span></a>
conquer, or they wanted to trade; or perhaps we could reduce the
motives to one&mdash;they wanted to conquer, because they wanted to
trade. In our own day we have seen a remarkable mixture of all three
motives, resulting in the European partition of Africa&mdash;perhaps
the most remarkable event of the latter end of the nineteenth century.
Speke and Burton, Livingstone and Stanley, investigated the interior
from love of adventure and of knowledge; then came the great chartered
trading companies; and, finally, the governments to which these
belong have assumed responsibility for the territories thus made
known to the civilised world. Within forty years the map of Africa,
which was practically a blank in the interior, and, as will be
shown, was better known in 1680 than in 1850, has been filled up
almost completely by researches due to motives of conquest, of
trade, or of scientific curiosity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In its earlier stages, then, the history of geographical discovery
is mainly a history of conquest, and what we shall have to do will
be to give a short history of the ancient world, from the point of
view of how that world became known. "Became known to whom?" you
may ask; and we must determine that question first. We might, of
course, take the earliest geographical work known to us&mdash;the
tenth chapter of Genesis&mdash;and work out how the rest of the
world became known to the Israelites when they became part of the
Roman Empire; but in history all roads lead to Rome or away from
it, and it is more useful for every
<a name="page 16"><span class="page">Page 16</span></a>
purpose to take Rome as our centre-point. Yet Rome only came in
as the heir of earlier empires that spread the knowledge of the
earth and man by conquest long before Rome was of importance; and
even when the Romans were the masters of all this vast inheritance,
they had not themselves the ability to record the geographical
knowledge thus acquired, and it is to a Greek named Ptolemy, a
professor of the great university of Alexandria, to whom we owe
our knowledge of how much the ancient world knew of the earth.
It will be convenient to determine this first, and afterwards to
sketch rapidly the course of historical events which led to the
knowledge which Ptolemy records.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the Middle Ages, much of this knowledge, like all other, was
lost, and we shall have to record how knowledge was replaced by
imagination and theory. The true inheritors of Greek science during
that period were the Arabs, and the few additions to real geographical
knowledge at that time were due to them, except in so far as commercial
travellers and pilgrims brought a more intimate knowledge of Asia
to the West.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The discovery of America forms the beginning of a new period, both
in modern history and in modern geography. In the four hundred
years that have elapsed since then, more than twice as much of
the inhabited globe has become known to civilised man than in the
preceding four thousand years. The result is that, except for a
few patches of Africa, South America, and round the Poles, man
<a name="page 17"><span class="page">Page 17</span></a>
knows roughly what are the physical resources of the world he inhabits,
and, except for minor details, the history of geographical discovery
is practically at an end.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Besides its interest as a record of war and adventure, this history
gives the successive stages by which modern men have been made what
they are. The longest known countries and peoples have, on the whole,
had the deepest influence in the forming of the civilised character.
Nor is the practical utility of this study less important. The way
in which the world has been discovered determines now-a-days the
world's history. The great problems of the twentieth century will
have immediate relation to the discoveries of America, of Africa,
and of Australia. In all these problems, Englishmen will have most
to say and to do, and the history of geographical discovery is,
therefore, of immediate and immense interest to Englishmen.

CHAPTER I
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
THE WORLD AS KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS
</p>

<p class="indent">
Before telling how the ancients got to know that part of the world
with which they finally became acquainted when the Roman Empire
was at its greatest extent, it is as well to get some idea of the
successive stages of their knowledge, leaving for the next chapter
the story of how that knowledge was obtained. As in most branches of
organised knowledge, it is to the Greeks that we owe our acquaintance
with ancient views of this subject. In the early stages they possibly
learned something from the Ph&oelig;nicians, who were the great traders
and sailors of antiquity, and who coasted along the Mediterranean,
ventured through the Straits of Gibraltar, and traded with the
British Isles, which they visited for the tin found in Cornwall. It
is even said that one of their admirals, at the command of Necho,
king of Egypt, circumnavigated Africa, for Herodotus reports that
on the homeward voyage the sun set in the sea on the right hand.
But the Ph&oelig;nicians kept their geographical knowledge to themselves
as a trade secret, and the Greeks learned but little from them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 19"><span class="page">Page 19</span></a>
The first glimpse that we have of the notions which the Greeks
possessed of the shape and the inhabitants of the earth is afforded
by the poems passing under the name of HOMER. These poems show an
intimate knowledge of Northern Greece and of the western coasts of
Asia Minor, some acquaintance with Egypt, Cyprus, and Sicily; but
all the rest, even of the Eastern Mediterranean, is only vaguely
conceived by their author. Where he does not know he imagines, and
some of his imaginings have had a most important influence upon
the progress of geographical knowledge. Thus he conceives of the
world as being a sort of flat shield, with an extremely wide river
surrounding it, known as Ocean. The centre of this shield was at
Delphi, which was regarded as the "navel" of the inhabited world.
According to Hesiod, who is but little later than Homer, up in the
far north were placed a people known as the <i>Hyperboreani</i>, or
those who dwelt at the back of the north wind; whilst a corresponding
place in the south was taken by the Abyssinians. All these four
conceptions had an important influence upon the views that men had
of the world up to times comparatively recent. Homer also mentioned
the pigmies as living in Africa. These were regarded as fabulous,
till they were re-discovered by Dr. Schweinfurth and Mr. Stanley
in our own time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is probably from the Babylonians that the Greeks obtained the
idea of an all-encircling ocean. Inhabitants of Mesopotamia would
<a name="page 20"><span class="page">Page 20</span></a>
find themselves reaching the ocean in almost any direction in which
they travelled, either the Caspian, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean,
or the Persian Gulf. Accordingly, the oldest map of the world which
has been found is one accompanying a cuneiform inscription, and
representing the plain of Mesopotamia with the Euphrates flowing
through it, and the whole surrounded by two concentric circles,
which are named briny waters. Outside these, however, are seven
detached islets, possibly representing the seven zones or climates
into which the world was divided according to the ideas of the
Babylonians, though afterwards they resorted to the ordinary four
cardinal points. What was roughly true of Babylonia did not in
any way answer to the geographical position of Greece, and it is
therefore probable that in the first place they obtained their
ideas of the surrounding ocean from the Babylonians.

THE EARLIEST MAP OF THE WORLD
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
It was after the period of Homer and Hesiod that the first great
expansion of Greek knowledge about the world began, through the
extensive colonisation which was carried on by the Greeks around
the Eastern Mediterranean. Even to this day the natives of the
southern part of Italy speak a Greek dialect, owing to the wide
extent of Greek colonies in that country, which used to be called
"Magna Grecia," or "Great Greece." Marseilles also one of the Greek
colonies (600 B.C.), which, in its turn, sent out other colonies
along the Gulf of Lyons. In the East, too, Greek cities were dotted
along the coast of
<a name="page 22"><span class="page">Page 22</span></a>
the Black Sea, one of which, Byzantium, was destined to be of
world-historic importance. So, too, in North Africa, and among the
islands of the &AElig;gean Sea, the Greeks colonised throughout the
sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and in almost every case communication
was kept up between the colonies and the mother-country.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now, the one quality which has made the Greeks so distinguished
in the world's history was their curiosity; and it was natural
that they should desire to know, and to put on record, the large
amount of information brought to the mainland of Greece from the
innumerable Greek colonies. But to record geographical knowledge,
the first thing that is necessary is a map, and accordingly it is
a Greek philosopher named ANAXIMANDER of Miletus, of the sixth
century B.C., to whom we owe the invention of map-drawing. Now,
in order to make a map of one's own country, little astronomical
knowledge is required. As we have seen, savages are able to draw
such maps; but when it comes to describing the relative positions
of countries divided from one another by seas, the problem is not
so easy. An Athenian would know roughly that Byzantium (now called
Constantinople) was somewhat to the east and to the north of him,
because in sailing thither he would have to sail towards the rising
sun, and would find the climate getting colder as he approached
Byzantium. So, too, he might roughly guess that Marseilles was
somewhere to the west and north of him; but how was he to fix the
relative position
<a name="page 23"><span class="page">Page 23</span></a>
of Marseilles and Byzantium to one another? Was Marseilles more
northerly than Byzantium? Was it very far away from that city?
For though it took longer to get to Marseilles, the voyage was
winding, and might possibly bring the vessel comparatively near
to Byzantium, though there might be no direct road between the
two cities. There was one rough way of determining how far north a
place stood: the very slightest observation of the starry heavens
would show a traveller that as he moved towards the north, the
pole-star rose higher up in the heavens. How much higher, could be
determined by the angle formed by a stick pointing to the pole-star,
in relation to one held horizontally. If, instead of two sticks, we
cut out a piece of metal or wood to fill up the enclosed angle, we
get the earliest form of the sun-dial, known as the <i>gnomon</i>,
and according to the shape of the gnomon the latitude of a place
is determined. Accordingly, it is not surprising to find that the
invention of the gnomon is also attributed to Anaximander, for
without some such instrument it would have been impossible for
him to have made any map worthy of the name. But it is probable
that Anaximander did not so much invent as introduce the gnomon,
and, indeed, Herodotus, expressly states that this instrument was
derived from the Babylonians, who were the earliest astronomers, so
far as we know. A curious point confirms this, for the measurement
of angles is by degrees, and degrees are divided into sixty seconds,
just as minutes are.
<a name="page 24"><span class="page">Page 24</span></a>
Now this division into sixty is certainly derived from Babylonia in
the case of time measurement, and is therefore of the same origin
as regards the measurement of angles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have no longer any copy of this first map of the world drawn
up by Anaximander, but there is little doubt that it formed the
foundation of a similar map drawn by a fellow-townsman of Anaximander,
HECAT&AElig;US of Miletus, who seems to have written the first formal
geography. Only fragments of this are extant, but from them we are
able to see that it was of the nature of a <i>periplus</i>, or
seaman's guide, telling how many days' sail it was from one point
to another, and in what direction. We know also that he arranged his
whole subject into two books, dealing respectively with Europe and
Asia, under which latter term he included part of what we now know
as Africa. From the fragments scholars have been able to reproduce
the rough outlines of the map of the world as it presented itself to
Hecat&aelig;us. From this it can be seen that the Homeric conception
of the surrounding ocean formed a chief determining feature in
Hecat&aelig;us's map. For the rest, he was acquainted with the
Mediterranean, Red, and Black Seas, and with the great rivers Danube,
Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, and Indus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next great name in the history of Greek geography is that of
HERODOTUS of Halicarnassus, who might indeed be equally well called
the Father of Geography as the Father of History. He travelled
much in Egypt, Babylonia,
<a name="page 25"><span class="page">Page 25</span></a>
Persia, and on the shores of the Black Sea, while he was acquainted
with Greece, and passed the latter years of his life in South Italy.
On all these countries he gave his fellow-citizens accurate and
tolerably full information, and he had diligently collected knowledge
about countries in their neighbourhood. In particular he gives full
details of Scythia (or Southern Russia), and of the satrapies and
royal roads of Persia. As a rule, his information is as accurate
as could be expected at such an early date, and he rarely tells
marvellous stories, or if he does, he points out himself their
untrustworthiness. Almost the only traveller's yarn which Herodotus
reports without due scepticism is that of the ants of India that were
bigger than foxes and burrowed out gold dust for their ant-hills.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One of the stories he relates is of interest, as seeming to show
an anticipation of one of Mr. Stanley's journeys. Five young men
of the Nasamonians started from Southern Libya, W. of the Soudan,
and journeyed for many days west till they came to a grove of trees,
when they were seized by a number of men of very small stature, and
conducted through marshes to a great city of black men of the same
size, through which a large river flowed. This Herodotus identifies
with the Nile, but, from the indication of the journey given by
him, it would seem more probable that it was the Niger, and that
the Nasamonians had visited Timbuctoo! Owing to this statement
<a name="page 26"><span class="page">Page 26</span></a>
of Herodotus, it was for long thought that the Upper Nile flowed
east and west.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After Herodotus, the date of whose history may be fixed at the
easily remembered number of 444 B.C., a large increase of knowledge
was obtained of the western part of Asia by the two expeditions of
Xenophon and of Alexander, which brought the familiar knowledge of
the Greeks as far as India. But besides these military expeditions
we have still extant several log-books of mariners, which might
have added considerably to Greek geography. One of these tells
the tale of an expedition of the Carthaginian admiral named Hanno,
down the western coast of Africa, as far as Sierra Leone, a voyage
which was not afterwards undertaken for sixteen hundred years.
Hanno brought back from this voyage hairy skins, which, he stated,
belonged to men and women whom he had captured, and who were known
to the natives by the name of Gorillas. Another log-book is that
of a Greek named Scylax, who gives the sailing distances between
nearly all ports on the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and the number
of days required to pass from one to another. From this it would seem
that a Greek merchant vessel could manage on the average fifty miles
a day. Besides this, one of Alexander's admirals, named Nearchus,
learned to carry his ships from the mouth of the Indus to the Arabian
Gulf. Later on, a Greek sailor, Hippalus, found out that by using
the monsoons at the appropriate times, he could sail direct from
Arabia to India without laboriously coasting
<a name="page 27"><span class="page">Page 27</span></a>
along the shores of Persia and Beluchistan, and in consequence
the Greeks gave his name to the monsoon. For information about
India itself, the Greeks were, for a long time, dependent upon
the account of Megasthenes, an ambassador sent by Seleucus, one
of Alexander's generals, to the Indian king of the Punjab.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While knowledge was thus gained of the East, additional information
was obtained about the north of Europe by the travels of one PYTHEAS,
a native of Marseilles, who flourished about the time of Alexander
the Great (333 B.C.), and he is especially interesting to us as
having been the first civilised person who can be identified as
having visited Britain. He seems to have coasted along the Bay of
Biscay, to have spent some time in England,&mdash;which he reckoned
as 40,000 stadia (4000 miles) in circumference,&mdash;and he appears
also to have coasted along Belgium and Holland, as far as the mouth
of the Elbe. Pytheas is, however, chiefly known in the history
of geography as having referred to the island of Thule, which he
described as the most northerly point of the inhabited earth, beyond
which the sea became thickened, and of a jelly-like consistency. He
does not profess to have visited Thule, and his account probably
refers to the existence of drift ice near the Shetlands.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All this new information was gathered together, and made accessible
to the Greek reading world, by ERATOSTHENES, librarian of Alexandria
(240-196 B.C.), who was practically the founder of
<a name="page 28"><span class="page">Page 28</span></a>
scientific geography. He was the first to attempt any accurate
measurement of the size of the earth, and of its inhabited portion.
By his time the scientific men of Greece had become quite aware
of the fact that the earth was a globe, though they considered
that it was fixed in space at the centre of the universe. Guesses
had even been made at the size of this globe, Aristotle fixing its
circumference at 400,000 stadia (or 40,000 miles), but Eratosthenes
attempted a more accurate measurement. He compared the length of
the shadow thrown by the sun at Alexandria and at Syene, near the
first cataract of the Nile, which he assumed to be on the same
meridian of longitude, and to be at about 5000 stadia (500 miles)
distance. From the difference in the length of the shadows he deduced
that this distance represented one-fiftieth of the circumference
of the earth, which would accordingly be about 250,000 stadia, or
25,000 geographical miles. As the actual circumference is 24,899
English miles, this was a very near approximation, considering
the rough means Eratosthenes had at his disposal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Having thus estimated the size of the earth, Eratosthenes then
went on to determine the size of that portion which the ancients
considered to be habitable. North and south of the lands known to
him, Eratosthenes and all the ancients considered to be either
too cold or too hot to be habitable; this portion he reckoned to
extend to 38,000 stadia, or 3800 miles. In reckoning the extent
of the habitable portion from east to west, Eratosthenes came to
the conclusion
<a name="page 29"><span class="page">Page 29</span></a>
that from the Straits of Gibraltar to the east of India was about
80,000 stadia, or, roughly speaking, one-third of the earth's surface.
The remaining two-thirds were supposed to be covered by the ocean,
and Eratosthenes prophetically remarked that "if it were not that
the vast extent of the Atlantic Sea rendered it impossible, one might
almost sail from the coast of Spain to that of India along the same
parallel." Sixteen hundred years later, as we shall see, Columbus
tried to carry out this idea. Eratosthenes based his calculations
on two fundamental lines, corresponding in a way to our equator
and meridian of Greenwich: the first stretched, according to him,
from Cape St. Vincent, through the Straits of Messina and the island
of Rhodes, to Issus (Gulf of Iskanderun); for his starting-line in
reckoning north and south he used a meridian passing through the
First Cataract, Alexandria, Rhodes, and Byzantium.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next two hundred years after Eratosthenes' death was filled
up by the spread of the Roman Empire, by the taking over by the
Romans of the vast possessions previously held by Alexander and
his successors and by the Carthaginians, and by their spread into
Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Much of the increased knowledge thus
obtained was summed up in the geographical work of STRABO, who
wrote in Greek about 20 B.C. He introduced from the extra knowledge
thus obtained many modifications of the system of Eratosthenes,
but, on the whole, kept to his general conception of the
<a name="page 30"><span class="page">Page 30</span></a>
world. He rejected, however, the existence of Thule, and thus made
the world narrower; while he recognised the existence of Ierne,
or Ireland; which he regarded as the most northerly part of the
habitable world, lying, as he thought, north of Britain.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Between the time of Strabo and that of Ptolemy, who sums up all
the knowledge of the ancients about the habitable earth, there was
only one considerable addition to men's acquaintance with their
neighbours, contained in a seaman's manual for the navigation of the
Indian Ocean, known as the <i>Periplus</i> of the Erythr&aelig;an
Sea. This gave very full and tolerably accurate accounts of the
coasts from Aden to the mouth of the Ganges, though it regarded
Ceylon as much greater, and more to the south, than it really is;
but it also contains an account of the more easterly parts of Asia,
Indo-China, and China itself, "where the silk comes from." This
had an important influence on the views of Ptolemy, as we shall
see, and indirectly helped long afterwards to the discovery of
America.

PTOLEMAEI ORBIS
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
It was left to PTOLEMY of Alexandria to sum up for the ancient
world all the knowledge that had been accumulating from the time
of Eratosthenes to his own day, which we may fix at about 150 A.D.
He took all the information he could find in the writings of the
preceding four hundred years, and reduced it all to one uniform
scale; for it is to him that we owe the invention of the method
and the names of latitude and longitude. Previous writers had been
content
<a name="page 32"><span class="page">Page 32</span></a>
to say that the distance between one point and another was so many
stadia, but he reduced all this rough reckoning to so many degrees
of latitude and longitude, from fixed lines as starting-points.
But, unfortunately, all these reckonings were rough calculations,
which are almost invariably beyond the truth; and Ptolemy, though
the greatest of ancient astronomers, still further distorted his
results by assuming that a degree was 500 stadia, or 50 geographical
miles. Thus when he found in any of his authorities that the distance
between one port and another was 500 stadia, he assumed, in the
first place, that this was accurate, and, in the second, that the
distance between the two places was equal to a degree of latitude
or longitude, as the case might be. Accordingly he arrived at the
result that the breadth of the habitable globe was, as he put it,
twelve hours of longitude (corresponding to 180&deg;)&mdash;nearly
one-third as much again as the real dimensions from Spain to China.
The consequence of this was that the distance from Spain to China
<i>westward</i> was correspondingly diminished by sixty degrees (or
nearly 4000 miles), and it was this error that ultimately encouraged
Columbus to attempt his epoch-making voyage.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Ptolemy's errors of calculation would not have been so extensive
but that he adopted a method of measurement which made them
accumulative. If he had chosen Alexandria for the point of departure
in measuring longitude, the errors he made when reckoning westward
would have been counterbalanced by those
<a name="page 33"><span class="page">Page 33</span></a>
reckoning eastward, and would not have resulted in any serious
distortion of the truth; but instead of this, he adopted as his
point of departure the Fortunat&aelig; Insul&aelig;, or Canary
Islands, and every degree measured to the east of these was one-fifth
too great, since he assumed that it was only fifty miles in length.
I may mention that so great has been the influence of Ptolemy on
geography, that, up to the middle of the last century, Ferro, in
the Canary Islands, was still retained as the zero-point of the
meridians of longitude.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Another point in which Ptolemy's system strongly influenced modern
opinion was his departure from the previous assumption that the
world was surrounded by the ocean, derived from Homer. Instead
of Africa being thus cut through the middle by the ocean, Ptolemy
assumed, possibly from vague traditional knowledge, that Africa
extended an unknown length to the south, and joined on to an equally
unknown continent far to the east, which, in the Latinised versions
of his astronomical work, was termed "terra australis incognita,"
or "the unknown south land." As, by his error with regard to the
breadth of the earth, Ptolemy led to Columbus; so, by his mistaken
notions as to the "great south land," he prepared the way for the
discoveries of Captain Cook. But notwithstanding these errors,
which were due partly to the roughness of the materials which he
had to deal with, and partly to scientific caution, Ptolemy's work
is one of the great monuments of human industry and knowledge.
<a name="page 34"><span class="page">Page 34</span></a>
For the Old World it remained the basis of all geographical knowledge
up to the beginning of the last century, just as his astronomical
work was only finally abolished by the work of Newton. Ptolemy
has thus the rare distinction of being the greatest authority on
two important departments of human knowledge&mdash;astronomy and
geography&mdash;for over fifteen hundred years. Into the details
of his description of the world it is unnecessary to go. The map
will indicate how near he came to the main outlines of the
Mediterranean, of Northwest Europe, of Arabia, and of the Black
Sea. Beyond these regions he could only depend upon the rough
indications and guesses of untutored merchants. But it is worth
while referring to his method of determining latitude, as it was
followed up by most succeeding geographers. Between the equator
and the most northerly point known to him, he divides up the earth
into horizontal strips, called by him "climates," and determined
by the average length of the longest day in each. This is a very
rough method of determining latitude, but it was probably, in most
cases, all that Ptolemy had to depend upon, since the measurement
of angles would be a rare accomplishment even in modern times,
and would only exist among a few mathematicians and astronomers
in Ptolemy's days. With him the history of geographical knowledge
and discovery in the ancient world closes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In this chapter I have roughly given the names and exploits of the
Greek men of science,
<a name="page 35"><span class="page">Page 35</span></a>
who summed up in a series of systematic records the knowledge obtained
by merchants, by soldiers, and by travellers of the extent of the
world known to the ancients. Of this knowledge, by far the largest
amount was gained, not by systematic investigation for the purpose of
geography, but by military expeditions for the purpose of conquest.
We must now retrace our steps, and give a rough review of the various
stages of conquest. We must now retrace our steps, and give a rough
review of the various stages of conquest by which the different
regions of the Old World became known to the Greeks and the Roman
Empire, whose knowledge Ptolemy summarises.

CHAPTER II
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
THE SPREAD OF CONQUEST IN THE ANCIENT WORLD
</p>

<p class="indent">
In a companion volume of this series, "The Story of Extinct
Civilisations in the East," will be found an account of the rise
and development of the various nations who held sway over the west
of Asia at the dawn of history. Modern discoveries of remarkable
interest have enabled us to learn the condition of men in Asia
Minor as early as 4000 B.C. All these early civilisations existed
on the banks of great rivers, which rendered the land fertile through
which they passed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We first find man conscious of himself, and putting his knowledge
on record, along the banks of the great rivers Nile, Euphrates,
and Tigris, Ganges and Yang-tse-Kiang. But for our purposes we
are not concerned with these very early stages of history. The
Egyptians got to know something of the nations that surrounded
them, and so did the Assyrians. A summary of similar knowledge
is contained in the list of tribes given in the tenth chapter of
Genesis, which divides all mankind, as then known to the Hebrews,
into descendants
<a name="page 37"><span class="page">Page 37</span></a>
of Shem, Ham, and Japhet&mdash;corresponding, roughly, to Asia,
Europe, and Africa. But in order to ascertain how the Romans obtained
the mass of information which was summarised for them by Ptolemy
in his great work, we have merely to concentrate our attention on
the remarkable process of continuous expansion which ultimately
led to the existence of the Roman Empire.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All early histories of kingdoms are practically of the same type.
A certain tract of country is divided up among a certain number
of tribes speaking a common language, and each of these tribes
ruled by a separate chieftain. One of these tribes then becomes
predominant over the rest, through the skill in war or diplomacy
of one of its chiefs, and the whole of the tract of country is thus
organised into one kingdom. Thus the history of England relates
how the kingdom of Wessex grew into predominance over the whole
of the country; that of France tells how the kings who ruled over
the Isle of France spread their rule over the rest of the land;
the history of Israel is mainly an account of how the tribe of
Judah obtained the hegemony of the rest of the tribes; and Roman
history, as its name implies, informs us how the inhabitants of
a single city grew to be the masters of the whole known world.
But their empire had been prepared for them by a long series of
similar expansions, which might be described as the successive
swallowing up of empire after empire, each becoming overgrown in
the process, till at last the series
<a name="page 38"><span class="page">Page 38</span></a>
was concluded by the Romans swallowing up the whole. It was this
gradual spread of dominion which, at each stage, increased men's
knowledge of surrounding nations, and it therefore comes within
our province to roughly sum up these stages, as part of the story
of geographical discovery.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Regarded from the point of view of geography, this spread of man's
knowledge might be compared to the growth of a huge oyster-shell,
and, from that point of view, we have to take the north of the
Persian Gulf as the apex of the shell, and begin with the Babylonian
Empire. We first have the kingdom of Babylon&mdash;which, in the
early stages, might be best termed Chald&aelig;a&mdash;in the south
of Mesopotamia (or the valley between the two rivers, Tigris and
Euphrates), which, during the third and second millennia before our
era, spread along the valley of the Tigris. But in the fourteenth
century B.C., the Assyrians to the north of it, though previously
dependent upon Babylon, conquered it, and, after various vicissitudes,
established themselves throughout the whole of Mesopotamia and
much of the surrounding lands. In 604 B.C. the capital of this
great empire was moved once more to Babylon, so that in the last
stage, as well as in the first, it may be called Babylonia. For
purposes of distinction, however, it will be as well to call these
three successive stages Chald&aelig;a, Assyria, and Babylonia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile, immediately to the east, a somewhat similar process had
been gone through,
<a name="page 39"><span class="page">Page 39</span></a>
though here the development was from north to south, the Medes
of the north developing a powerful empire in the north of Persia,
which ultimately fell into the hands of Cyrus the Great in 546
B.C. He then proceeded to conquer the kingdom of Lydia, in the
northwest part of Asia Minor, which had previously inherited the
dominions of the Hittites. Finally he proceeded to seize the empire
of Babylonia, by his successful attack on the capital, 538 B.C. He
extended his rule nearly as far as India on one side, and, as we
know from the Bible, to the borders of Egypt on the other. His son
Cambyses even succeeded in adding Egypt for a time to the Persian
Empire. The oyster-shell of history had accordingly expanded to
include almost the whole of Western Asia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next two centuries are taken up in universal history by the
magnificent struggle of the Greeks against the Persian Empire&mdash;the
most decisive conflict in all history, for it determined whether
Europe or Asia should conquer the world. Hitherto the course of
conquest had been from east to west, and if Xerxes' invasion had
been successful, there is little doubt that the westward tendency
would have continued. But the larger the tract of country which an
empire covers&mdash;especially when different tribes and nations
are included in it&mdash;the weaker and less organised it becomes.
Within little more than a century of the death of Cyrus the Great
the Greeks discovered the vulnerable point in the Persian Empire,
owing to an expedition of ten thousand Greek
<a name="page 40"><span class="page">Page 40</span></a>
mercenaries under Xenophon, who had been engaged by Cyrus the younger
in an attempt to capture the Persian Empire from his brother. Cyrus
was slain, 401 B.C., but the ten thousand, under the leadership of
Xenophon, were enabled, to hold their own against all the attempts
of the Persians to destroy them, and found their way back to Greece.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile the usual process had been going on in Greece by which a
country becomes consolidated. From time to time one of the tribes
into which that mountainous country was divided obtained supremacy
over the rest: at first the Athenians, owing to the prominent part
they had taken in repelling the Persians; then the Spartans, and
finally the Thebans. But on the northern frontiers a race of hardy
mountaineers, the Macedonians, had consolidated their power, and,
under Philip of Macedon, became masters of all Greece. Philip had
learned the lesson taught by the successful retreat of the ten
thousand, and, just before his death, was preparing to attack the
Great King (of Persia) with all the forces which his supremacy in
Greece put at his disposal. His son Alexander the Great carried
out Philip's intentions. Within twelve years (334-323 B.C.) he had
conquered Persia, Parthia, India (in the strict sense, <i>i.e.</i>
the valley of the Indus), and Egypt. After his death his huge empire
was divided up among his generals, but, except in the extreme east,
the whole of it was administered on Greek methods. A Greek-speaking
person could pass from one
<a name="page 41"><span class="page">Page 41</span></a>
end to the other without difficulty, and we can understand how a
knowledge of the whole tract of country between the Adriatic and
the Indus could be obtained by Greek scholars. Alexander founded
a large number of cities, all bearing his name, at various points
of his itinerary; but of these the most important was that at the
mouth of the Nile, known to this day as Alexandria. Here was the
intellectual centre of the whole Hellenic world, and accordingly
it was here, as we have seen, that Eratosthenes first wrote down
in a systematic manner all the knowledge about the habitable earth
which had been gained mainly by Alexander's conquests.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Important as was the triumphant march of Alexander through Western
Asia, both in history and in geography, it cannot be said to have
added so very much to geographical knowledge, for Herodotus was
roughly acquainted with most of the country thus traversed, except
towards the east of Persia and the north-west of India. But the
itineraries of Alexander and his generals must have contributed
more exact knowledge of the distances between the various important
centres of population, and enabled Eratosthenes and his successors
to give them a definite position on their maps of the world. What
they chiefly learned from Alexander and his immediate successors
was a more accurate knowledge of North-West India. Even as late
as Strabo, the sole knowledge possessed at Alexandria of Indian
places was that given by Megasthenes,
<a name="page 42"><span class="page">Page 42</span></a>
the ambassador to India in the third century B.C.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile, in the western portion of the civilised world a similar
process had gone on. In the Italian peninsula the usual struggle
had gone on between the various tribes inhabiting it. The fertile
plain of Lombardy was not in those days regarded as belonging to
Italy, but was known as Cisalpine Gaul. The south of Italy, as we
have seen, was mainly inhabited by Greek colonists, and was called
Great Greece. Between these tracts of country the Italian territory
was inhabited by three sets of federate tribes&mdash;the Etrurians,
the Samnites, and the Latins. During the 230 years between 510
B.C. and 280 B.C. Rome was occupied in obtaining the supremacy
among these three sets of tribes, and by the latter date may be
regarded as having consolidated Central Italy into an Italian
federation, centralised at Rome. At the latter date, the Greek
king Pyrrhus of Epirus, attempted to arouse the Greek colonies
in Southern Italy against the growing power of Rome; but his
interference only resulted in extending the Roman dominion down
to the heel and big toe of Italy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If Rome was to advance farther, Sicily would be the next step, and
just at that moment Sicily was being threatened by the other great
power of the West&mdash;Carthage. Carthage was the most important
of the colonies founded by the Ph&oelig;nicians (probably in the ninth
century B.C.), and pursued in the Western Mediterranean
<a name="page 43"><span class="page">Page 43</span></a>
the policy of establishing trading stations along the coast, which
had distinguished the Ph&oelig;nicians from their first appearance
in history. They seized all the islands in that division of the sea,
or at any rate prevented any other nation from settling in Corsica,
Sardinia, and the Balearic Isles. In particular Carthage took possession
of the western part of Sicily, which had been settled by sister
Ph&oelig;nician colonies. While Rome did everything in its power to
consolidate its conquests by admitting the other Italians to some
share in the central government, Carthage only regarded its foreign
possessions as so many openings for trade. In fact, it dealt with
the western littoral of the Mediterranean something like the East
India Company treated the coast of Hindostan: it established factories
at convenient spots. But just as the East India Company found it
necessary to conquer the neighbouring territory in order to secure
peaceful trade, so Carthage extended its conquests all down the
western coast of Africa and the south-east part of Spain, while Rome
was extending into Italy. To continue our conchological analogy, by
the time of the first Punic War Rome and Carthage had each expanded
into a shell, and between the two intervened the eastern section of
the island of Sicily. As the result of this, Rome became master
of Sicily, and then the final struggle took place with Hannibal in
the second Punic War, which resulted in Rome becoming possessed
of Spain and Carthage.
<a name="page 44"><span class="page">Page 44</span></a>
By the year 200 B.C. Rome was practically master of the Western
Mediterranean, though it took another century to consolidate its
heritage from Carthage in Spain and Mauritania. During that
century&mdash;the second before our era&mdash;Rome also extended
its Italian boundaries to the Alps by the conquest of Cisalpine
Gaul, which, however, was considered outside Italy, from which it
was separated by the river Rubicon. In that same century the Romans
had begun to interfere in the affairs of Greece, which easily fell
into their hands, and thus prepared the way for their inheritance
of Alexander's empire.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This, in the main, was the work of the first century before our
era, when the expansion of Rome became practically concluded. This
was mainly the work of two men, C&aelig;sar and Pompey. Following
the example of his uncle, Marius, C&aelig;sar extended the Roman
dominions beyond the Alps to Gaul, Western Germany, and Britain;
but from our present standpoint it was Pompey who prepared the way
for Rome to carry on the succession of empire in the more civilised
portions of the world, and thereby merited his title of "Great." He
pounded up, as it were, the various states into which Asia Minor was
divided, and thus prepared the way for Roman dominion over Western
Asia and Egypt. By the time of Ptolemy the empire was thoroughly
consolidated, and his map and geographical notices are only tolerably
accurate within the confines of the empire.

<p class="indent">
One of the means by which the Romans
<a name="page 46"><span class="page">Page 46</span></a>
were enabled to consolidate their dominion must be here shortly
referred to. In order that their legions might easily pass from one
portion of this huge empire to another, they built roads, generally
in straight lines, and so solidly constructed that in many places
throughout Europe they can be traced even to the present day, after
the lapse of fifteen hundred years. Owing to them, in a large measure,
Rome was enabled to preserve its empire intact for nearly five
hundred years, and even to this day one can trace a difference in
the civilisation of those countries over which Rome once ruled,
except where the devastating influence of Islam has passed like
a sponge over the old Roman provinces. Civilisation, or the art
of living together in society, is practically the result of Roman
law, and this sense all roads in history lead to Rome.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The work of Claudius Ptolemy sums up to us the knowledge that the
Romans had gained by their inheritance, on the western side, of the
Carthaginian empire, and, on the eastern, of the remains of Alexander's
empire, to which must be added the conquests of C&aelig;sar in
North-West Europe. C&aelig;sar is, indeed, the connecting link between
the two shells that had been growing throughout ancient history. He
added Gaul, Germany, and Britain to geographical knowledge, and,
by his struggle with Pompey, connected the Levant with his northerly
conquests. One result of his imperial work must be here referred
to. By bringing all civilised men under one rule, he prepared them
for the worship of one God. This was not without its
<a name="page 47"><span class="page">Page 47</span></a>
influence on travel and geographical discovery, for the great barrier
between mankind had always been the difference of religion, and
Rome, by breaking down the exclusiveness of local religions, and
substituting for them a general worship of the majesty of the Emperor,
enabled all the inhabitants of this vast empire to feel a certain
communion with one another, which ultimately, as we know, took
on a religious form.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Roman Empire will henceforth form the centre from which to
regard any additions to geographical knowledge. As we shall see,
part of the knowledge acquired by the Romans was lost in the Dark
Ages succeeding the break-up of the empire; but for our purposes
this may be neglected and geographical discovery in the succeeding
chapters may be roughly taken to be additions and corrections of
the knowledge summed up by Claudius Ptolemy.

CHAPTER III

<p class="subtitle">
GEOGRAPHY IN THE DARK AGES
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have seen how, by a slow process of conquest and expansion, the
ancient world got to know a large part of the Eastern Hemisphere,
and how this knowledge was summed up in the great work of Claudius
Ptolemy. We have now to learn how much of this knowledge was lost
or perverted&mdash;how geography, for a time, lost the character
of a science, and became once more the subject of mythical fancies
similar to those which we found in its earliest stages. Instead of
knowledge which, if not quite exact, was at any rate approximately
measured, the medi&aelig;val teachers who concerned themselves with
the configuration of the inhabited world substituted their own
ideas of what ought to be.[1] This is a process which applies not
alone to geography, but to all branches of knowledge, which, after
the fall of the Roman Empire, ceased to expand or progress, became
mixed up with fanciful notions, and only recovered when a knowledge
of ancient science and thought was restored in the fifteenth
<a name="page 49"><span class="page">Page 49</span></a>
century. But in geography we can more easily see than in other
sciences the exact nature of the disturbing influence which prevented
the acquisition of new knowledge.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: It is fair to add that Professor Miller's researches
have shown that some of the "unscientific" qualities of the
medi&aelig;val <i>mapp&oelig; mundi</i> were due to Roman models.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Briefly put, that disturbing influence was religion, or rather
theology; not, of course, religion in the proper sense of the word,
or theology based on critical principles, but theological conceptions
deduced from a slavish adherence to texts of Scripture, very often
seriously misunderstood. To quote a single example: when it is
said in Ezekiel v. S, "This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the
midst of the nations... round about her," this was not taken by
the medi&aelig;val monks, who were the chief geographers of the
period, as a poetical statement, but as an exact mathematical law,
which determined the form which all medi&aelig;val maps took. Roughly
speaking, of course, there was a certain amount of truth in the
statement, since Jerusalem would be about the centre of the world
as known to the ancients&mdash;at least, measured from east to
west; but, at the same time, the medi&aelig;val geographers adopted
the old Homeric idea of the ocean surrounding the habitable world,
though at times there was a tendency to keep more closely to the
words of Scripture about the four corners of the earth. Still, as
a rule, the orthodox conception of the world was that of a circle
enclosing a sort of T square, the east being placed at the top,
Jerusalem in the centre; the Mediterranean Sea naturally divided
the lower half of the circle, while the &AElig;gean and Red Seas were
<a name="page 50"><span class="page">Page 50</span></a>
regarded as spreading out right and left perpendicularly, thus
dividing the top part of the world, or Asia, from the lower part,
divided equally between Europe on the left and Africa on the right.
The size of the Mediterranean Sea, it will be seen, thus determined
the dimensions of the three continents. One of the chief errors to
which this led was to cut off the whole of the south of Africa,
which rendered it seemingly a short voyage round that continent
on the way to India. As we shall see, this error had important
and favourable results on geographical discovery.

GEOGRAPHICAL MONSTERS

</div>

<p class="indent">
Another result of this conception of the world as a T within an
O, was to expand Asia to an enormous extent; and as this was a
part of the world which was less known to the monkish map-makers
of the Middle Ages, they were obliged to fill out their ignorance
by their imagination. Hence they located in Asia all the legends
which they had derived either from Biblical or classical sources.
Thus there was a conception, for which very little basis is to be
found in the Bible, of two fierce nations named Gog and Magog,
who would one day bring about the destruction of the civilised
world. These were located in what would have been Siberia, and
it was thought that Alexander the Great had penned them in behind
the Iron Mountains. When the great Tartar invasion came in the
thirteenth century, it was natural to suppose that these were no
less than the Gog and Magog of legend. So, too, the position of
Paradise was fixed in the extreme east,
<a name="page 51"><span class="page">Page 51</span></a>
or, in other words, at the top of medi&aelig;val maps. Then, again,
some of the classical authorities, as Pliny and Solinus, had admitted
into their geographical accounts legends of strange tribes of monstrous
men, strangely different from normal humanity. Among these may be
mentioned the Sciapodes, or men whose feet were so large that when
it was hot they could rest on their backs and lie in the shade.
There is a dim remembrance of these monstrosities in Shakespeare's
reference to
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br>
&nbsp;Do grow beneath their shoulders."
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the mythical travels of Sir John Maundeville there are illustrations
of these curious beings, one of which is here reproduced. Other
<a name="page 52"><span class="page">Page 52</span></a>
tracts of country were supposed to be inhabited by equally monstrous
animals. Illustrations of most of these were utilised to fill up
the many vacant spaces in the medi&aelig;val maps of Asia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One author, indeed, in his theological zeal, went much further in
modifying the conceptions of the habitable world. A Christian merchant
named Cosmas, who had journeyed to India, and was accordingly known
as COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES, wrote, about 540 A.D., a work entitled
"Christian Topography," to confound what he thought to be the erroneous
views of Pagan authorities about the configuration of the world. What
especially roused his ire was the conception of the spherical form
of the earth, and of the Antipodes, or men who could stand upside
down. He drew a picture of a round ball, with four men standing
upon it, with their feet on opposite sides, and asked triumphantly
how it was possible that all four could stand upright? In answer
to those who asked him to explain how he could account for day
and night if the sun did not go round the earth, he supposed that
there was a huge mountain in the extreme north, round which the sun
moved once in every twenty-four hours. Night was when the sun was
going round the other side of the mountain. He also proved, entirely
to his own satisfaction, that the sun, instead of being greater,
was very much smaller than the earth. The earth was, according to
him, a moderately sized plane, the inhabited parts of which were
separated from the antediluvian world by the ocean, and at the
four corners of
<a name="page 53"><span class="page">Page 53</span></a>
the whole were the pillars which supported the heavens, so that
the whole universe was something like a big glass exhibition case,
on the top of which was the firmament, dividing the waters above
and below it, according to the first chapter of Genesis.

<p class="indent">
Cosmas' views, however interesting and amusing they are, were too
extreme to gain
<a name="page 54"><span class="page">Page 54</span></a>
much credence or attention
even from the medi&aelig;val monks, and we find no reference to them
in the various <i>mapp&oelig; mundi</i> which sum up their knowledge,
or rather ignorance, about the world. One of the most remarkable of
these maps exists in England at Hereford, and the plan of it given
on <a href="#page 53">p. 53</a> will convey as much information
as to early medi&aelig;val geography as the ordinary reader will
require. In the extreme east, <i>i.e.</i> at the top, is represented
the Terrestrial Paradise; in the centre is Jerusalem; beneath this,
the Mediterranean extends to the lower edge of the map, with its
islands very carefully particularised. Much attention is given
to the rivers throughout, but very little to the mountains. The
only real increase of actual knowledge represented in the map is
that of the north-east of Europe, which had I naturally become
better known by the invasion of the Norsemen. But how little real
knowledge was possessed of this portion of Europe is proved by
the fact that the mapmaker placed near Norway the Cynocephali, or
dog-headed men, probably derived from some confused accounts of
Indian monkeys. Near them are placed the Gryphons, "men most wicked,
for among their misdeeds they also make garments for themselves and
their horses out of the skins of their enemies." Here, too, is
placed the home of the Seven Sleepers, who lived for ever as a
standing miracle to convert the heathen. The shape given to the
British Islands will be observed as due to the necessity of keeping
the circular form of the
<a name="page 55"><span class="page">Page 55</span></a>
inhabited world. Other details about England we may leave for the
present.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is obvious that maps such as the Hereford one would be of no
practical utility to travellers who desired to pass from one country
to another; indeed, they were not intended for any such purpose.
Geography had ceased to be in any sense a practical science; it
only ministered to men's sense of wonder, and men studied it mainly
in order to learn about the marvels of the world. When William
of Wykeham drew up his rules for the Fellows and Scholars of New
College, Oxford, he directed them in the long winter evenings to
occupy themselves with "singing, or reciting poetry, or with the
chronicles of the different kingdoms, or with the <i>wonders of
the world</i>." Hence almost all medi&aelig;val maps are filled
up with pictures of these wonders, which were the more necessary
as so few people could read. A curious survival of this custom
lasted on in map-drawing almost to the beginning of this century,
when the spare places in the ocean were adorned with pictures of
sailing ships or spouting sea monsters.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When men desired to travel, they did not use such maps as these,
but rather itineraries, or road-books, which did not profess to
give the shape of the countries through which a traveller would
pass, but only indicated the chief towns on the most-frequented
roads. This information was really derived from classical times,
for the Roman emperors from time to time directed such road-books
to be drawn up, and there
<a name="page 56"><span class="page">Page 56</span></a>
still remains an almost complete itinerary of the Empire, known
as the Peutinger Table, from the name of the German merchant who
first drew the attention of the learned world to it. A condensed
reproduction is given on the following page, from which it will
be seen that no attempt is made to give anything more than the
roads and towns. Unfortunately, the first section of the table,
which started from Britain, has been mutilated, and we only get
the Kentish coast. These itineraries were specially useful, as
the chief journeys of men were in the nature of pilgrimages; but
these often included a sort of commercial travelling, pilgrims
often combining business and religion on their journeys. The chief
information about Eastern Europe which reached the West was given
by the succession of pilgrims who visited Palestine up to the time
of the Crusades. Our chief knowledge of the geography of Europe
daring the five centuries between 500 and 1000 A.D. is given in
the reports of successive pilgrims.

</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
This period may be regarded as the Dark Age of geographical knowledge,
during which wild conceptions like those contained in the Hereford
map were substituted for the more accurate measurements of the
ancients. Curiously enough, almost down to the time of Columbus
the learned kept to these conceptions, instead of modifying them by
the extra knowledge gained during the second period of the Middle
Ages, when travellers of all kinds obtained much fuller information
of Asia, North
<a name="page 58"><span class="page">Page 58</span></a>
Europe, and even, as, we shall see, of some parts of America.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is not altogether surprising that this period should have been
so backward in geographical knowledge, since the map of Europe
itself, in its political divisions, was entirely readjusted during
this period. The thousand years of history which elapsed between 450
and 1450 were practically taken up by successive waves of invasion
from the centre of Asia, which almost entirely broke up the older
divisions of the world.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the fifth century three wandering tribes, invaded the Empire, from
the banks of the Vistula, the Dnieper, and the Volga respectively. The
Huns came from the Volga, in the extreme east, and under Attila, "the
Hammer of God," wrought consternation in the Empire; the Visigoths,
from the Dnieper, attacked the Eastern Empire; while the Vandals,
from the Vistula, took a triumphant course through Gaul and Spain,
and founded for a time a Vandal empire in North Africa. One of the
consequences of this movement was to drive several of the German
tribes into France, Italy, and Spain, and even over into Britain;
for it is from this stage in the world's history that we can trace
the beginning of England, properly so called, just as the invasion
of Gaul by the Franks at this time means the beginning of French
history. By the eighth century the kingdom of the Franks extended
all over France, and included most of Central Germany; while on
Christmas Day, 800, Charles
<a name="page 59"><span class="page">Page 59</span></a>
the Great was crowned at Rome, by the Pope, Emperor of the Holy
Roman Empire, which professed to revive the glories of the old
empire, but made a division between the temporal power held by the
Emperor and the spiritual power held by the Pope.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One of the divisions of the Frankish Empire deserves attention,
because upon its fate rested the destinies of most of the nations
of Western Europe. The kingdom of Burgundy, the buffer state between
France and Germany, has now entirely disappeared, except as the
name of a wine; but having no natural boundaries, it was disputed
between France and Germany for a long period, and it may be fairly
said that the Franco-Prussian War was the last stage in its history
up to the present. A similar state existed in the east of Europe,
viz. the kingdom of Poland, which was equally indefinite in shape,
and has equally formed a subject of dispute between the nations
of Eastern Europe. This, as is well known, only disappeared as
an independent state in 1795, when it finally ceased to act as a
buffer between Russia and the rest of Europe. Roughly speaking,
after the settlement of the Germanic tribes within the confines of
the Empire, the history of Europe, and therefore its historical
geography, may be summed up as a struggle for the possession of
Burgundy and Poland.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But there was an important interlude in the south-west of Europe,
which must engage our attention as a symptom of a world-historic
change in the condition of civilisation. During
<a name="page 60"><span class="page">Page 60</span></a>
the course of the seventh and eighth centuries (roughly, between
622 and 750) the inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula burst the
seclusion which they had held since the beginning, almost, of history,
and, inspired by the zeal of the newly-founded religion of Islam,
spread their influence from India to Spain, along the southern
littoral of the Mediterranean. When they had once settled down,
they began to recover the remnants of Gr&aelig;co-Roman science
that had been lost on the north shores of the Mediterranean. The
Christians of Syria used Greek for their sacred language, and
accordingly when the Sultans of Bagdad desired to know something
of the wisdom of the Greeks, they got Syriac-speaking Christians
to translate some of the scientific works of the Greeks, first
into Syriac, and thence into Arabic. In this way they obtained a
knowledge of the great works of Ptolemy, both in astronomy&mdash;which
they regarded as the more important, and therefore the greatest,
Almagest&mdash;and also in geography, though one can easily understand
the great modifications which the strange names of Ptolemy must have
undergone in being transcribed, first into Syriac and then into
Arabic. We shall see later on some of the results of the Arabic
Ptolemy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The conquests of the Arabs affected the knowledge of geography
in a twofold way: by bringing about the Crusades, and by renewing
the acquaintance of the west with the east of Asia. The Arabs were
acquainted with South-Eastern Africa as far south as Zanzibar and
<a name="page 61"><span class="page">Page 61</span></a>
Sofala, though, following the views of Ptolemy as to the Great
Unknown South Land, they imagined that these spread out into the
Indian Ocean towards India. They seem even to have had some vague
knowledge of the sources of the Nile. They were also acquainted
with Ceylon, Java, and Sumatra, and they were the first people to
learn the various uses to which the cocoa-nut can be put. Their
merchants, too, visited China as early as the ninth century, and we
have from their accounts some of the earliest descriptions of the
Chinese, who were described by them as a handsome people, superior
in beauty to the Indians, with fine dark hair, regular features,
and very like the Arabs. We shall see later on how comparatively
easy it was for a Mohammedan to travel from one end of the known
world to the other, owing to the community of religion throughout
such a vast area.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some words should perhaps be said on the geographical works of
the Arabs. One of the most important of these, by Yacut, is in the
form of a huge Gazetteer, arranged in alphabetical order; but the
greatest geographical work of the Arabs is by EDRISI, geographer to
King Roger of Sicily, 1154, who describes the world somewhat after
the manner of Ptolemy, but with modifications of some interest. He
divides the world into seven horizontal strips, known as "climates,"
and ranging from the equator to the British Isles. These strips are
subdivided into eleven sections, so that the world, in Edrisi's
conception, is like a chess-board, divided into
<a name="page 62"><span class="page">Page 62</span></a>
seventy-seven squares, and his work consists of an elaborate description
of each of these squares taken one by one, each climate being worked
through regularly, so that you might get parts of France in the

</span>
</span>

eighth and ninth squares, and other parts in the sixteenth and
seventeenth. Such a method was not adapted to give a clear conception
of separate countries, but this was scarcely Edrisi's object. When
the Arabs&mdash;or, indeed, any of the ancient or medi&aelig;val
writers&mdash;wanted
<a name="page 63"><span class="page">Page 63</span></a>
wanted to describe a land, they wrote about the tribe or nation
inhabiting it, and not about the position of the towns in it; in
other words, they drew a marked distinction between ethnology and
geography.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the geography of the Arabs had little or no influence upon
that of Europe, which, so far as maps went, continued to be based
on fancy instead of fact almost up to the time of Columbus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile another movement had been going on during the eighth and
ninth centuries, which helped to make Europe what it is, and extended
considerably the common knowledge of the northern European peoples.
For the first time since the disappearance of the Ph&oelig;nicians,
a great naval power came into existence in Norway, and within a
couple of centuries it had influenced almost the whole sea-coast
of Europe. The Vikings, or Sea-Rovers, who kept their long ships
in the <i>viks</i>, or fjords, of Norway, made vigorous attacks
all along the coast of Europe, and in several cases formed stable
governments, and so made, in a way, a sort of crust for Europe,
preventing any further shaking of its human contents. In Iceland, in
England, in Ireland, in Normandy, in Sicily, and at Constantinople
(where they formed the <i>Varangi</i>, or body-guard of the Emperor),
as well as in Russia, and for a time in the Holy Land, Vikings or
Normans founded kingdoms between which there was a lively interchange

<p class="indent">
They certainly extended their voyages to Greenland, and there is
a good deal of evidence
<a name="page 64"><span class="page">Page 64</span></a>
for believing that they travelled from Greenland to Labrador and
Newfoundland. In the year 1001, an Icelander named Biorn, sailing
to Greenland to visit his father, was driven to the south-west, and
came to a country which they called Vinland, inhabited by dwarfs,
and having a shortest day of eight hours, which would correspond
roughly to 50&deg; north latitude. The Norsemen settled there,
and as late as 1121 the Bishop of Greenland visited them, in order
to convert them to Christianity. There is little reason to doubt
that this Vinland was on the mainland of North America, and the
Norsemen were therefore the first Europeans to discover America.
As late as 1380, two Venetians, named Zeno, visited Iceland, and
reported that there was a tradition there of a land named Estotiland,
a thousand miles west of the Faroe Islands, and south of Greenland.
The people were reported to be civilised and good seamen, though
unacquainted with the use of the compass, while south of them were
savage cannibals, and still more to the south-west another civilised
people, who built large cities and temples, but offered up human
victims in them. There seems to be here a dim knowledge of the
Mexicans.

<p class="indent">
The great difficulty in maritime discovery, both for the ancients
and the men of the Middle Ages, was the necessity of keeping close
to the shore. It is true they might guide themselves by the sun
during the day, and by the pole-star at night, but if once the
sky was overcast, they would become entirely at a loss for their
bearings. Hence the discovery of the
<a name="page 65"><span class="page">Page 65</span></a>
polar tendency of the magnetic needle was a necessary prelude to
any extended voyages away from land. This appears to have been
known to the Chinese from quite ancient times, and utilised on
their junks as early as the eleventh century. The Arabs, who voyaged
to Ceylon and Java, appear to have learnt its use from the Chinese,
and it is probably from them that the mariners of Barcelona first
introduced its use into Europe. The first mention of it is given in
a treatise on Natural History by Alexander Neckam, foster-brother of
Richard, C&oelig;ur de Lion. Another reference, in a satirical poem
of the troubadour, Guyot of Provence (1190), states that mariners
can steer to the north star without seeing it, by following the
direction of a needle floating in a straw in a basin of water,
after it had been touched by a magnet. But little use, however,
seems to have been made of this, for Brunetto Latini, Dante's tutor,
when on a visit to Roger Bacon in 1258, states that the friar had
shown him the magnet and its properties, but adds that, however
useful the discovery, "no master mariner would dare to use it,
lest he should be thought to be a magician." Indeed, in the form in
which it was first used it would be of little practical utility, and
it was not till the method was found of balancing it on a pivot and
fixing it on a card, as at present used, that it became a necessary
part of a sailor's outfit. This practical improvement is attributed
to one Flavio Gioja, of Amalfi, in the beginning of the fourteenth
century.

THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN THE PORTULANI.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 66"><span class="page">Page 66</span></a>
When once the mariner's compass had come into general use, and
its indications observed by master mariners in their voyages, a
much more practical method was at hand for determining the relative
positions of the different lands. Hitherto geographers (<i>i.e.</i>,
mainly the Greeks and Arabs) had had to depend for fixing relative
positions on the vague statements in the itineraries of merchants and
soldiers; but now, with the aid of the compass, it was not difficult
to determine the relative position of one point to another, while
all the windings of a road could be fixed down on paper without
much difficulty. Consequently, while the learned monks were content
with the mixture of myth and fable which we have seen to have formed
the basis of their maps of the world, the seamen of the Mediterranean
were gradually building up charts of that sea and the neighbouring
lands which varied but little from the true position. A chart of
this kind was called a Portulano, as giving information of the
best routes from port to port, and Baron Nordenskiold has recently
shown how all these <i>portulani</i> are derived from a single
Catalan map which has been lost, but must have been compiled between
1266 and 1291. And yet there were some of the learned who were
not above taking instruction from the practical knowledge of the
seamen. In 1339, one Angelico Dulcert, of Majorca, made an elaborate
map of the world on the principle of the portulano, giving the coast
line&mdash;at least of the Mediterranean&mdash;with remarkable
accuracy. A little later, in 1375, a
<a name="page 68"><span class="page">Page 68</span></a>
Jew of the same island, named Cresquez, made an improvement on
this by introducing into the eastern parts of the map the recently
acquired knowledge of Cathay, or China, due to the great traveller
Marco Polo. His map (generally known as the Catalan Map, from the
language of the inscriptions plentifully scattered over it) is
divided into eight horizontal strips, and on the preceding page will
be found a reduced reproduction, showing how very accurately the
coast line of the Mediterranean was reproduced in these portulanos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
With the portulanos, geographical knowledge once more came back to
the lines of progress, by reverting to the representation of fact,
and, by giving an accurate representation of the coast line, enabled
mariners to adventure more fearlessly and to return more safely,
while they gave the means for recording any further knowledge. As
we shall see, they aided Prince Henry the Navigator to start that
series of geographical investigation which led to the discoveries
that close the Middle Ages. With them we may fairly close the history
of medi&aelig;val geography, so far as it professed to be a systematic
branch of knowledge.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We must now turn back and briefly sum up the additions to knowledge
made by travellers, pilgrims, and merchants, and recorded in literary
shape in the form of travels.

<p class="subtitle">
MEDI&AElig;VAL TRAVELS
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the Middle Ages&mdash;that is, in the thousand years between
the irruption of the barbarians into the Roman Empire in the fifth
century and the discovery of the New World in the fifteenth&mdash;the
chief stages of history which affect the extension of men's knowledge
of the world were: the voyages of the Vikings in the eighth and
ninth centuries, to which we have already referred; the Crusades,
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; and the growth of the
Mongol Empire in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The extra
knowledge obtained by the Vikings did not penetrate to the rest
of Europe; that brought by the Crusades, and their predecessors,
the many pilgrimages to the Holy Land, only restored to Western
Europe the knowledge already stored up in classical antiquity;
but the effect of the extension of the Mongol Empire was of more
wide-reaching importance, and resulted in the addition of knowledge
about Eastern Asia which was not possessed by the Romans, and has
only been surpassed in modern times during the present century.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Towards the beginning of the thirteenth
<a name="page 70"><span class="page">Page 70</span></a>
century, Chinchiz Khan, leader of a small Tatar tribe, conquered
most of Central and Eastern Asia, including China. Under his son,
Okkodai, these Mongol Tatars turned from China to the West, conquered
Armenia, and one of the Mongol generals, named Batu, ravaged South
Russia and Poland, and captured Buda-Pest, 1241. It seemed as if
the prophesied end of the world had come, and the mighty nations
Gog and Magog had at last burst forth to fulfil the prophetic words.
But Okkodai died suddenly, and these armies were recalled. Universal
terror seized Europe, and the Pope, as the head of Christendom,
determined to send ambassadors to the Great Khan, to ascertain
his real intentions. He sent a friar named John of Planocarpini,
from Lyons, in 1245, to the camp of Batu (on the Volga), who passed
him on to the court of the Great Khan at Karakorum, the capital of
his empire, of which only the slightest trace is now left on the
left bank of the Orkhon, some hundred miles south of Lake Baikal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Here, for the first time, they heard of a kingdom on the east coast
of Asia which was not yet conquered by the Mongols, and which was
known by the name of Cathay. Fuller information was obtained by
another friar, named WILLIAM RUYSBROEK, or Rubruquis, a Fleming,
who also visited Karakorum as an ambassador from St. Louis, and got
back to Europe in 1255, and communicated some of his information to
Roger Bacon. He says: "These Cathayans are little fellows, speaking
much through the
<a name="page 71"><span class="page">Page 71</span></a>
nose, and, as is general with all those Eastern people, their eyes
are very narrow.... The common money of Cathay consists of pieces
of cotton paper; about a palm in length and breadth, upon which
certain lines are printed, resembling the seal of Mangou Khan.
They do their writing with a pencil such as painters paint with,
and a single character of theirs comprehends several letters, so
as to form a whole word." He also identifies these Cathayans with
the Seres of the ancients. Ptolemy knew of these as possessing
the land where the silk comes from, but he had also heard of the
Sin&aelig;, and failed to identify the two. It has been conjectured
that the name of China came to the West by the sea voyage, and is
a Malay modification, while the names Seres and Cathayans came
overland, and thus caused confusion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Other Franciscans followed these, and one of them, John of Montecorvino,
settled at Khanbalig (imperial city), or Pekin, as Archbishop (ob.
1358); while Friar Odoric of Pordenone, near Friuli, travelled in
India and China between 1316 and 1330, and brought back an account
of his voyage, filled with most marvellous mendacities, most of
which were taken over bodily into the work attributed to Sir John
Maundeville.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The information brought back by these wandering friars fades, however,
into insignificance before the extensive and accurate knowledge of
almost the whole of Eastern Asia brought back to Europe by Marco
Polo, a Venetian, who
<a name="page 72"><span class="page">Page 72</span></a>
spent eighteen years of his life in the East. His travels form
an epoch in the history of geographical discovery only second to
the voyages of Columbus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1260, two of his uncles, named Nicolo and Maffeo Polo, started
from Constaninople on a trading venture to the Crimea, after which
they were led to visit Bokhara, and thence on to the court of the
Great Khan, Kublai, who received them very graciously, and being
impressed with the desirability of introducing Western civilisation
into the new Mongolian empire, he entrusted them with a message to
the Pope, demanding one hundred wise men of the West to teach the
Mongolians the Christian religion and Western arts. The two brothers
returned to their native place, Venice, in 1269, but found no Pope
to comply with the Great Khan's request; for Clement IV. had died
the year before, and his successor had not yet been appointed. They
waited about for a couple of years till Gregory X. was elected, but he
only meagrely responded to the Great Khan's demands, and instructed
two Dominicans to accompany the Polos, who on this occasion took
with them their young nephew Marco, a lad of seventeen. They started
in November 1271, but soon lost the company of the Dominicans,
who lost heart and went back.
</p>

<p class="indent">
They went first to Ormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, then
struck northward through Khorasan Balkh to the Oxus, and thence
on to the Plateau of Pomir. Thence they passed the Great Desert
of Gobi, and at last reached
<a name="page 73"><span class="page">Page 73</span></a>
Kublai in May 1275, at his summer residence in Kaipingfu.
Notwithstanding that they had not carried out his request, the
Khan received them in a friendly manner, and was especially taken
by Marco, whom he took into his own service; and quite recently a
record has been found in the Chinese annals, stating that in the
year 1277 a certain Polo was nominated a Second-Class Commissioner
of the PrivyCouncil. His duty was to travel on various missions
to Eastern Tibet, to Cochin China, and even to India. The Polos
amassed much wealth owing to the Khan's favour, but found him very
unwilling to let them return to Europe. Marco Polo held several
important posts; for three years he was Governor of the great city
of Yanchau, and it seemed likely that he would die in the service
of Kublai Khan.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But, owing to a fortunate chance, they were at last enabled to get
back to Europe. The Khan of Persia desired to marry a princess of
the Great Khan's family, to whom he was related, and as the young
lady upon whom the choice fell could not be expected to undergo
the hardships of the overland journey from China to Persia, it was
decided to send her by sea round the coast of Asia. The Tatars
were riot good navigators, and the Polos at last obtained permission
to escort the young princess on the rather perilous voyage. They
started in 1292, from Zayton, a port in Fokien, and after a voyage
of over two years round the South coast of Asia, successfully carried
the lady to her destined home, though she ultimately had to marry the
<a name="page 74"><span class="page">Page 74</span></a>
son instead of the father, who had died in the interim. They took
leave of her, and travelled through Persia to their own place, which
they reached in 1295. When they arrived at the ancestral mansion
of the Polos, in their coarse dress of Tatar cut, their relatives
for some time refused to believe that they were really the long-lost
merchants. But the Polos invited them to a banquet, in which they
dressed themselves all in their best, and put on new suits for
every course, giving the clothes they had taken off to the servants.
At the conclusion of the banquet they brought forth the shabby
dresses in which they had first arrived, and taking sharp knives,
began to rip up the seams, from which they took vast quantities of
rubies, sapphires, carbuncles, diamonds, and emeralds, into which
form they had converted most of their property. This exhibition
naturally changed the character of the welcome they received from
their relatives, who were then eager to learn how they had come
by such riches.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In describing the wealth of the Great Khan, Marco Polo, who was
the chief spokesman of the party, was obliged to use the numeral
"million" to express the amount of his wealth and the number of
the population over whom he ruled. This was regarded as part of
the usual travellers' tales, and Marco Polo was generally known
by his friends as "Messer Marco Millione."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such a reception of his stories was no great encouragement to Marco
to tell the tale of his remarkable travels, but in the year of his
<a name="page 75"><span class="page">Page 75</span></a>
arrival at Venice a war broke out between Genoa and the Queen of
the Adriatic, in which Marco Polo was captured and cast into prison
at Genoa. There he found as a fellow-prisoner one Rusticano of Pisa,
a man of some learning and a sort of predecessor of Sir Thomas
Malory, since he had devoted much time to re-writing, in prose,
abstracts of the many romances relating to the Round Table. These
he wrote, not in Italian (which can scarcely be said to have existed
for literary purposes in those days), but in French, the common
language of chivalry throughout Western Europe. While in prison
with Marco Polo, he took down in French the narrative of the great
traveller, and thus preserved it for all time. Marco Polo was released
in 1299, and returned to Venice, where he died some time after 9th
January 1334, the date of his will.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of the travels thus detailed in Marco Polo's book, and of their
importance and significance in the history of geographical discovery,
it is impossible to give any adequate account in this place. It
will, perhaps, suffice if we give the summary of his claims made
out by Colonel Sir Henry Yule, whose edition of his travels is
one of the great monuments of English learning:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="indent">
"He was the first traveller to trace a route across the whole longitude
of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after kingdom which he had
seen with his own eyes: the deserts of Persia, the flowering plateaux
and wild gorges of Badakhshan, the jade-bearing rivers of Khotan,
the Mongolian Steppes, cradle of the power that had so
<a name="page 76"><span class="page">Page 76</span></a>
lately threatened to swallow up Christendom, the new and brilliant
court that had been established by Cambaluc; the first traveller
to reveal China in all its wealth and vastness, its mighty rivers,
its huge cities, its rich manufactures, its swarming population,
the inconceivably vast fleets that quickened its seas and its inland
waters; to tell us of the nations on its borders, with all their
eccentricities of manners and worship; of Tibet, with its sordid
devotees; of Burma, with its golden pagodas and their tinkling
crowns; of Laos, of Siam, of Cochin China, of Japan, the Eastern
Thule, with its rosy pearls and golden-roofed palaces; the first
to speak of that museum of beauty and wonder, still so imperfectly
ransacked, the Indian Archipelago, source of those aromatics then
so highly prized, and whose origin was so dark; of Java, the pearl
of islands; of Sumatra, with its many kings, its strange costly
products, and its cannibal races; of the naked savages of Nicobar
and Andaman; of Ceylon, the island of gems, with its sacred mountain,
and its tomb of Adam; of India the Great, not as a dreamland of
Alexandrian fables, but as a country seen and personally explored,
with its virtuous Brahmans, its obscene ascetics, its diamonds,
and the strange tales of their acquisition, its sea-beds of pearl,
and its powerful sun: the first in medi&aelig;val times to give any
distinct account of the secluded Christian empire of Abyssinia,
and the semi-Christian island of Socotra; to speak, though indeed
dimly, of Zanzibar, with its negroes and its ivory, and of the
vast and distant Madagascar, bordering on the dark ocean of the
South, with its Ruc and other monstrosities, and, in a remotely
opposite region, of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, of dog-sledges,
white bears, and reindeer-riding Tunguses."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Marco Polo's is thus one of the greatest names in the history of
geography; it may, indeed, be doubted whether any other traveller
has ever added so extensively to our detailed knowledge of the
earth's surface. Certainly up to the time of Mr. Stanley no man
had on land
<a name="page 77"><span class="page">Page 77</span></a>
visited so many places previously unknown to civilised Europe.
But the lands he discovered, though already fully populated, were
soon to fall into disorder, and to be closed to any civilising

influences. Nothing for a long time followed from these discoveries,
and indeed almost up to the present day his accounts were received
with incredulity, and he himself was
<a name="page 78"><span class="page">Page 78</span></a>
regarded more as "Marco Millione" than as Marco Polo.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Extensive as were Marco Polo's travels, they were yet exceeded in
extent, though not in variety, by those of the greatest of Arabian
travellers, Mohammed Ibn Batuta, a native of Tangier, who began his
travels in 1334, as part of the ordinary duty of a good Mohammedan
to visit the holy city of Mecca. While at Alexandria he met a learned
sage named Borhan Eddin, to whom he expressed his desire to travel.
Borhan said to him, "You must then visit my brother Farid Iddin and
my brother Rokn Eddin in Scindia, and my brother Borhan Eddin in
China. When you see them, present my compliments to them." Owing
mainly to the fact that the Tatar princes had adopted Islamism
instead of Christianity, after the failure of Gregory X. to send
Christian teachers to China, Ibn Batuta was ultimately enabled to
greet all three brothers of Borhan Eddin. Indeed, he performed
a more extraordinary exploit, for he was enabled to convey the
greetings of the Sheikh Kawan Eddin, whom he met in China, to a
relative of his residing in the Soudan. During the thirty years
of his travels he visited the Holy Land, Armenia, the Crimea,
Constantinople (which he visited in company with a Greek princess,
who married one of the Tatar Khans), Bokhara, Afghanistan, and
Delhi. Here he found favour with the emperor Mohammed Inghlak,
who appointed him a judge, and sent him on an embassy to China,
at first overland, but, as this
<a name="page 79"><span class="page">Page 79</span></a>
was found too dangerous a route, he went ultimately from Calicut,
via Ceylon, the Maldives, and Sumatra, to Zaitun, then the great
port of China. Civil war having broken out, he returned by the
same route to Calicut, but dared not face the emperor, and went
on to Ormuz and Mecca, and returned to Tangier in 1349. But even
then his taste for travel had not been exhausted. He soon set out
for Spain, and worked his way through Morocco, across the Sahara,
to the Soudan. He travelled along the Niger (which he took for
the Nile), and visited Timbuctoo. He ultimately returned to Fez
in 1353, twenty-eight years after he had set out on his travels.
Their chief interest is in showing the wide extent of Islam in his
day, and the facilities which a common creed gave for extensive
travel. But the account of his journeys was written in Arabic,
and had no influence on European knowledge, which, indeed, had
little to learn from him after Marco Polo, except with regard to
the Soudan. With him the history of medi&aelig;val geography may
be fairly said to end, for within eighty years of his death began
the activity of Prince Henry the Navigator, with whom the modern
epoch begins.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile India had become somewhat better known, chiefly by the
travels of wandering friars, who visited it mainly for the sake of
the shrine of St. Thomas, who was supposed to have been martyred
in India. Mention should also be made of the early spread of the
Nestorian Church throughout Central Asia. As early as the seventh
<a name="page 80"><span class="page">Page 80</span></a>
century the Syrian Christians who followed the views of Nestorius began
spreading them eastward, founding sees in Persia and Turkestan, and
ultimately spreading as far as Pekin. There was a certain revival of
their missionary activity under the Mongol Khans, but the restricted
nature of the language in which their reports were written prevented
them from having any effect upon geographical knowledge, except in
one particular, which is of some interest. The fate of the Lost
Ten Tribes of Israel has always excited interest, and a legend arose
that they had been converted to Christianity, and existed somewhere
in the East under a king who was also a priest, and known as Prester
John. Now, in the reports brought by some of the Nestorian priests
westward, it was stated that one of the Mongol princes named Ung Khan
had adopted Christianity, and as this in Syriac sounded something
like "John the Cohen," or "Priest," he was identified with the Prester
John of legend, and for a long time one of the objects of travel in
the East was to discover this Christian kingdom. It was, however,
later ascertained that there did exist such a Christian kingdom in
Abyssinia, and as owing to the erroneous views of Ptolemy, followed
by the Arabs, Abyssinia was considered to spread towards Farther
India, the land of Prester John was identified in Abyssinia. We
shall see later on how this error helped the progress of geographical
discovery.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The total addition of these medi&aelig;val travels
<a name="page 81"><span class="page">Page 81</span></a>
to geographical knowledge consisted mainly in the addition of a
wider extent of land in China, and the archipelago of Japan, or
Cipangu, to the map of the world. The accompanying map displays
the various travels and voyages of importance, and will enable
the reader to understand how students of geography, who added on
to Ptolemy's estimate of the extent of the world east and west the
new knowledge acquired by Marco Polo, would still further decrease
the distance westward between Europe and Cipangu, and thus prepare
men for the voyage of Columbus.

<p class="subtitle">
ROADS AND COMMERCE
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have now conducted the course of our inquiries through ancient
times and the Middle Ages up to the very eve of the great discoveries
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and we have roughly indicated
what men had learned about the earth during that long period, and,
how they learned it. But it still remains to consider by what means
they arrived at their knowledge, and why they sought for it. To some
extent we may have answered the latter question when dealing with
the progress of conquest, but men did not conquer merely for the
sake of conquest. We have still to consider the material advantages
attaching to warfare. Again when men go on their wars of discovery,
they have to progress, for the most part, along paths already beaten
for them by the natives of the country they intend to conquer; and
often when they have succeeded in warfare, they have to consolidate
their rule by creating new and more appropriate means of communication.
To put it shortly, we have still to discuss the roads of the ancient
and medi&aelig;val worlds, and the commerce for which those roads
were mainly used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 83"><span class="page">Page 83</span></a>
A road may be, for our purposes, most readily defined as the most
convenient means of communication between two towns; and this logically
implies that the towns existed before the roads were made; and in a
fuller investigation of any particular roads, it will be necessary
to start by investigating why men collect their dwellings at certain
definite spots. In the beginning, assemblies of men were made chiefly
or altogether for defensive purposes, and the earliest towns were
those which, from their natural position, like Athens or Jerusalem,
could be most easily defended. Then, again, religious motives often
had their influence in early times, and towns would grow round
temples or cloisters. But soon considerations of easy accessibility
rule in the choice of settlements, and for that purpose towns on
rivers, especially at fords of rivers, as Westminster, or in
well-protected harbours like Naples, or in the centre of a district,
as Nuremberg or Vienna, would form the most convenient places of
meeting for exchange of goods. Both on a river, or on the sea-shore,
the best means of communication would be by ships or boats; but
once such towns had been established, it would be necessary to
connect them with one another by land routes, and these would be
determined chiefly by the lie of the land. Where mountains interfered,
a large detour would have to be made&mdash;as, for example, round
the Pyrenees; if rivers intervened, fords would have to be sought
for, and a new town probably built at the most convenient place
of passage.
<a name="page 84"><span class="page">Page 84</span></a>
When once a recognised way had been found between any two places,
the conservative instincts of man would keep it in existence, even
though a better route were afterwards found.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The influence of water communication is of paramount importance
in determining the situation of towns in early times. Towns in
the corners of bays, like Archangel, Riga, Venice, Genoa, Naples,
Tunis, Bassorah, Calcutta, would naturally be the centre-points
of the trade of the bay. On rivers a suitable spot would be where
the tides ended, like London, or at conspicuous bends of a stream,
or at junctures with affluents, as Coblentz or Khartoum. One nearly
always finds important towns at the two ends of a peninsula, like
Hamburg and Lubeck, Venice and Genoa; though for naval purposes
it is desirable to have a station at the head of the peninsula,
to command both arms of the sea, as at Cherbourg, Sevastopol, or
Gibraltar. Roads would then easily be formed across the base of
the peninsula, and to its extreme point.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At first the inhabitants of any single town would regard those
of all others as their enemies, but after a time they would find
it convenient to exchange some of their superfluities for those
of their neighbours, and in this way trade would begin. Markets
would become neutral ground, in which mutual animosities would
be, for a time, laid aside for the common advantage; and it would
often happen that localities on the border line of two states would
be chosen
<a name="page 85"><span class="page">Page 85</span></a>
as places for the exchange of goods, ultimately giving rise to the
existence of a fresh town. As commercial intercourse increased,
the very inaccessibility of fortress towns on the heights would
cause them to be neglected for settlements in the valleys or by
the river sides, and, as a rule, roads pick out valleys or level
ground for their natural course. For military purposes, however,
it would sometimes be necessary to depart from the valley routes,
and, as we shall see, the Roman roads paid no regard to these
requirements.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The earliest communication between nations, as we have seen, was that
of the Ph&oelig;nicians by sea. They founded factories, or neutral
grounds for trade, at appropriate spots all along the Mediterranean
coasts, and the Greeks soon followed their example in the &AElig;gean
and Black Seas. But at an early date, as we know from the Bible,
caravan routes were established between Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia,
and later on these were extended into Farther Asia. But in Europe
the great road-builders were the Romans. Rome owed its importance
in the ancient world to its central position, at first in Italy,
and then in the whole of the Mediterranean. It combined almost
all the advantages necessary for a town: it was in the bend of
a river, yet accessible from the sea; its natural hills made it
easily defensible, as Hannibal found to his cost; while its central
position in the Latian Plain made it the natural resort of all
the Latin traders. The Romans soon found it necessary to utilise
their central
<a name="page 86"><span class="page">Page 86</span></a>
position by rendering themselves accessible to the rest of Italy,
and they commenced building those marvellous roads, which in most
cases have remained, owing to their solid construction. "Building"
is the proper word to use, for a Roman road is really a broad wall
built in a deep ditch so as to come up above the level of the surface.
Scarcely any amount of traffic could wear this solid substructure
away, and to this day throughout Europe traces can be found of
the Roman roads built nearly two thousand years ago. As the Roman
Empire extended, these roads formed one of the chief means by which
the lords of the world were enabled to preserve their conquests.
By placing a legion in a central spot, where many of these roads
converged, they were enabled to strike quickly in any direction
and overawe the country. Stations were naturally built along these
roads, and to the present day many of the chief highways of Europe
follow the course of the old Roman roads. Our modern civilisation
is in a large measure the outcome of this network of roads, and
we can distinctly trace a difference in the culture of a nation
where such roads never existed&mdash;as in Russia and Hungary,
as contrasted with the west of Europe, where they formed the best
means of communication. It was only in the neighbourhood of these
highways that the fullest information was obtained of the position
of towns, and the divisions of peoples; and a sketch map like the
one already given, of the chief Roman roads of antiquity, gives
also, as it were, a skeleton
<a name="page 87"><span class="page">Page 87</span></a>
of the geographical knowledge summed up in the great work of Ptolemy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But of more importance for the future development of geographical
knowledge were the great caravan routes of Asia, to which we must
now turn our attention. Asia is the continent of plateaux which
culminate in the Steppes of the Pamirs, appropriately called by
their inhabitants "the Roof of the World." To the east of these,
four great mountain ranges run, roughly, along the parallels of
latitude&mdash;the Himalayas to the south, the Kuen-Iun, Thian
Shan, and Altai to the north. Between the Himalayas and the Kuen-lun
is the great Plateau of Tibet, which runs into a sort of cul-de-sac
at its western end in Kashmir. Between the Kuen-lun and the Thian
Shan we have the Gobi Steppe of Mongolia, running west of Kashgar
and Yarkand; while between the Thian Shan and the Altai we have
the great Kirghiz Steppe. It is clear that only two routes are
possible between Eastern and Western Asia: that between the Kuen-lun
and the Thian Shan via Kashgar and Bokhara, and that south of the
Altai, skirting the north of the great lakes Balkash, Aral, and
Caspian, to the south of Russia. The former would lead to Bassorah
or Ormuz, and thence by sea, or overland, round Arabia to Alexandria;
the latter and longer route would reach Europe via Constantinople.
Communication between Southern Asia and Europe would mainly be
by sea, along the coast of the Indies, taking advantage of the
monsoons from Ceylon to Aden, and then by the Red Sea. Alexandria,
<a name="page 88"><span class="page">Page 88</span></a>
Bassorah, and Ormuz would thus naturally be the chief centres of Eastern
trade, while communication with the Mongols or with China would go
along the two routes above mentioned, which appear to have existed
during all historic time. It was by these latter routes that the
Polos and the other medi&aelig;val travellers to Cathay reached
that far-distant country. But, as we know from Marco Polo's travels,
China could also be reached by the sea voyage; and for all practical
purposes, in the late Middle Ages, when the Mongol empire broke
up, and traffic through mid Asia was not secure, communication
with the East was via Alexandria.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now it is important for our present inquiry to realise how largely
Europe after the Crusades was dependent on the East for most of the
luxuries of life. Nothing produced by the looms of Europe could
equal the silk of China, the calico of India, the muslin of Mussul.
The chief gems which decorated the crowns of kings and nobles,
the emerald, the topaz, the ruby, the diamond, all came from the
East&mdash;mainly from India. The whole of medi&aelig;val medical
science was derived from the Arabs, who sought most of their drugs
from Arabia or India. Even for the incense which burned upon the
innumerable altars of Roman Catholic Europe, merchants had to seek
the materials in the Levant. For many of the more refined handicrafts,
artists had to seek their best material from Eastern traders: such
as shellac for varnish, or mastic for artists' colours (gamboge
from Cambodia, ultramarine from lapis lazuli);
<a name="page 89"><span class="page">Page 89</span></a>
while it was often necessary, under medi&aelig;val circumstances,
to have resort to the musk or opopanax of the East to counteract
the odours resulting from the bad sanitary habits of the West.
But above all, for the condiments which were almost necessary for
health, and certainly desirable for seasoning the salted food of
winter and the salted fish of Lent. Europeans were dependent upon the
spices of the Asiatic islands. In Hakluyt's great work on "English
Voyages and Navigations," he gives in his second volume a list,
written out by an Aleppo merchant, William Barrett, in 1584, of
the places whence the chief staples of the Eastern trade came, and
it will be interesting to give a selection from his long account.

<p class="indent">
These are only a few selections from Barrett's list, but will
sufficiently indicate what a large number of household luxuries,
and even necessities, were derived from Asia in the Middle Ages.
The Arabs had practically the monopoly of this trade, and as Europe
had scarcely anything to offer in exchange except its gold and
silver coins, there was a continuous drain of the precious metals
from West to East, rendering the Sultans and Caliphs continuously
richer, and culminating in the splendours of Solomon the Magnificent.
Alexandria was practically the centre of all this trade, and most
of the nations of Europe found it necessary to establish factories
in that city, to safeguard the interests of their merchants, who
all sought for Eastern luxuries in its port
<a name="page 91"><span class="page">Page 91</span></a>
Benjamin of Tudela, a Jew, who visited it about 1172, gives the
following description of it:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="indent">
"The city is very mercantile, and affords an excellent market to
all nations. People from all Christian kingdoms resort to Alexandria,
from Valencia, Tuscany, Lombardy, Apulia, Amalfi, Sicilia, Raguvia,
Catalonia, Spain, Roussillon, Germany, Saxony, Denmark, England,
Flandres, Hainault, Normandy, France, Poitou, Anjou, Burgundy,
Mediana, Provence, Genoa, Pisa, Gascony, Arragon, and Navarre.
From the West you meet Mohammedans from Andalusia, Algarve, Africa,
and Arabia, as well as from the countries towards India, Savila,
Abyssinia, Nubia, Yemen, Mesopotamia, and Syria, besides Greeks
and Turks. From India they import all sorts of spices, which are
bought by Christian merchants. The city is full of bustle, and
every nation has its own fonteccho (or hostelry) there."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of all these nations, the Italians had the shortest voyage to make
before reaching Alexandria, and the Eastern trade practically fell
into their hands before the end of the thirteenth century. At first
Amalfi and Pisa were the chief ports, and, as we have seen, it
was at Amalfi that the mariner's compass was perfected; but soon
the two maritime towns at the heads of the two seas surrounding
Italy came to the front, owing to the advantages of their natural
position. Genoa and Venice for a long time competed with one another
for the monopoly of this trade, but the voyage from Venice was
more direct, and after a time Genoa had to content itself with
the trade with Constantinople and the northern overland route from
China. From Venice the spices, the jewels, the perfumes, and stuffs
of the East were transmitted
<a name="page 92"><span class="page">Page 92</span></a>
north through Augsburg and N&uuml;rnberg to Antwerp and Bruges and
the Hanse Towns, receiving from them the gold they had gained by
their fisheries and textile goods. England sent her wool to Italy,
in order to tickle her palate and her nose with the condiments and
perfumes of the East.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The wealth and importance of Venice were due almost entirely to
this monopoly of the lucrative Eastern trade. By the fifteenth
century she had extended her dominions all along the lower valley
of the Po, into Dalmatia, parts of the Morea, and in Crete, till
at last, in 1489, she obtained possession of Cyprus, and thus had
stations all the way from Aleppo or Alexandria to the north of
the Adriatic. But just as she seemed to have reached the height
of her prosperity&mdash;when the Aldi were the chief printers in
Europe, and the Bellini were starting the great Venetian school
of painting&mdash;a formidable rival came to the front, who had
been slowly preparing a novel method of competition in the Eastern
trade for nearly the whole of the fifteenth century. With that
method begins the great epoch of modern geographical discovery.

CHAPTER VI
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
TO THE INDIES EASTWARD&mdash;PRINCE HENRY AND VASCO DA GAMA
</p>

<p class="indent">
Up to the fifteenth century the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula
were chiefly occupied in slowly moving back the tide of Mohammedan
conquest, which had spread nearly throughout the country from 711
onwards. The last sigh of the Moor in Spain was to be uttered in
1492&mdash;an epoch-making year, both in history and in geography.
But Portugal, the western side of the peninsula, had got rid of
her Moors at a much earlier date&mdash;more that 200 years
before&mdash;though she found it difficult to preserve her independence
from the neighbouring kingdom of Castile. The attempt of King Juan
of Castile to conquer the country was repelled by Jo&atilde;o,
a natural son of the preceding king of Portugal, and in 1385 he
became king, and freed Portugal from any danger on the side of
Castile by his victory at Aljubarrota. He married Philippa, daughter
of John of Gaunt; and his third son, Henry, was destined to be the
means of revolutionising men's views of the inhabited globe. He first
showed his mettle in the capture of Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar, at
<a name="page 94"><span class="page">Page 94</span></a>
the time of the battle of Agincourt, 1415, and by this means he
first planted the Portuguese banner on the Moorish coast. This
contact with the Moors may possibly have first suggested to Prince
Henry the idea of planting similar factory-fortresses among the
Mussulmans of India; but, whatever the cause, he began, from about
the year 1418, to devote all his thoughts and attention to the
possibility of reaching India otherwise than through the known routes,
and for that purpose established himself on the rocky promontory of
Sagres, almost the most western spot on the continent of Europe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Here he established an observatory, and a seminary for the training of
theoretical and practical navigators. He summoned thither astronomers
and cartographers and skilled seamen, while he caused stouter and
larger vessels to be built for the express purpose of exploration.
He perfected the astrolabe (the clumsy predecessor of the modern
sextant) by which the latitude could be with some accuracy determined;
and he equipped all his ships with the compass, by which their
steering was entirely determined. He brought from Majorca (which,
as we have seen, was the centre of practical map-making in the
fourteenth century) one Mestre Jacme, "a man very skilful in the
art of navigation, and in the making of maps and instruments."
With his aid, and doubtless that of others, he set himself to study
the problem of the possibility of a sea voyage to India round the
coast of Africa.

PROGRESS OF PORTUGUESE DISCOVERY
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
We have seen that Ptolemy, with true scientific
<a name="page 96"><span class="page">Page 96</span></a>
caution, had left undefined the extent of Africa to the south;
but Eratosthenes and many of the Roman geographers, even after
Ptolemy, were not content with this agnosticism, but boldly assumed
that the coast of Africa made a semicircular sweep from the right
horn of Africa, just south of the Red Sea, with which they were
acquainted, round to the north-western shore, near what we now
term Morocco. If this were the fact, the voyage by the ocean along
this sweep of shore would be even shorter than the voyage through
the Mediterranean and Red Seas, while of course there would be no
need for disembarking at the Isthmus of Suez. The writers who thus
curtailed Africa of its true proportions assumed another continent
south of it, which, however, was in the torrid zone, and completely
uninhabitable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now the north-west coast of Africa was known in Prince Henry's
days as far as Cape Bojador. It would appear that Norman sailors
had already advanced beyond Cape Non, or Nun, which was so called
because it was supposed that nothing existed beyond it. Consequently
the problems that Prince Henry had to solve were whether the coast of
Africa trended sharply to the east after Cape Bojador, and whether
the ideas of the ancients about the uninhabitability of the torrid
zone were justified by fact. He attempted to solve these problems by
sending out, year after year, expeditions down the north-west coast of
Africa, each of which penetrated farther than its predecessor. Almost
<a name="page 97"><span class="page">Page 97</span></a>
at the beginning he was rewarded by the discovery, or re-discovery,
of Madeira in 1420, by Jo&atilde;o Gonsalvez Zarco, one of the squires
of his household. For some time he was content with occupying this
and the neighbouring island of Porto Santo, which, however, was
ruined by the rabbits let loose upon it. On Madeira vines from
Burgundy were planted, and to this day form the chief industry
of the island. In 1435 Cape Bojador was passed, and in 1441 Cape
Branco discovered. Two years later Cape Verde was reached and passed
by Nuno Trist&atilde;o, and for the first time there were signs that
the African coast trended eastward. By this time Prince Henry's
men had become familiar with the natives along the shore and no less
than one thousand of them had been brought back and distributed
among the Portuguese nobles as pages and attendants. In 1455 a
Venetian, named Alvez Cadamosto, undertook a voyage still farther
south for purposes of trade, the Prince supplying the capital, and
covenanting for half profits on results. They reached the mouth
of the Gambia, but found the natives hostile. Here for the first
time European navigators lost sight of the pole-star and saw the
brilliant constellation of the Southern Cross. The last discovery
made during Prince Henry's life was that of the Cape Verde Islands,
by one of his captains, Diogo Gomez, in 1460&mdash;the very year of
his death. As the successive discoveries were made, they were jotted
down by the Prince's cartographers on portulanos, and just before
<a name="page 98"><span class="page">Page 98</span></a>
his death the King of Portugal sent to a Venetian monk, Fra Mauro,
details of all discoveries up to that time, to be recorded on a
<i>mappa mundi</i>, a copy of which still exists
(<a href="#page 77">p. 77</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The impulse thus given by Prince Henry's patient investigation of
the African coast continued long after his death. In 1471 Fernando
de Poo discovered the island which now bears his name, while in
the same year Pedro d'Escobar crossed the equator. Wherever the
Portuguese investigators landed they left marks of their presence,
at first by erecting crosses, then by carving on trees Prince Henry's
motto, "Talent de bien faire," and finally they adopted the method
of erecting stone pillars, surmounted by a cross, and inscribed with
the king's arms and name. These pillars were called <i>padraos</i>.
In 1484, Diego Cam, a knight of the king's household, set up one of
these pillars at the mouth of a large river, which he therefore
called the Rio do Padrao; it was called by the natives the Zaire, and
is now known as the River Congo. Diego Cam was, on this expedition,
accompanied by Martin Behaim of N&uuml;rnberg, whose globe is celebrated
in geographical history as the last record of the older views
(<a href="#page 115">p. 115</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile, from one of the envoys of the native kings who visited
the Portuguese Court, information was received that far to the east
of the countries hitherto discovered there was a great Christian
king. This brought to mind the medi&aelig;val tradition of Prester
John, and accordingly the Portuguese determined to make a double
attempt, both by sea and by land, to
<a name="page 99"><span class="page">Page 99</span></a>
reach this monarch. By sea the king sent two vessels under the
command of Bartholomew Diaz, while by land he despatched, in the
following year, two men acquainted with Arabic, Pedro di Covilham
and Affonso de Payba. Covilham reached Aden, and there took ship
for Calicut, being the first Portuguese to sail the Indian Ocean.
He then returned to Sofala, and obtained news of the Island of the
Moon, now known as Madagascar. With this information he returned
to Cairo, where he found ambassadors from Jo&atilde;o, two Jews,
Abraham of Beja and Joseph of Lamejo. These he sent back with the
information that ships that sailed down the coast of Guinea would
surely reach the end of Africa, and when they arrived in the Eastern
Ocean they should ask for Sofala and the Island of the Moon. Meanwhile
Covilham returned to the Red Sea, and made his way into Abyssinia,
where he married and settled down, transmitting from time to time
information to Portugal which gave Europeans their first notions
of Abyssinia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The voyage by land in search of Prester John had thus been completely
successful, while, at the same time, information had been obtained
giving certain hopes of the voyage by sea. This had, in its way,
been almost as successful, for Diaz had rounded the cape now known
as the Cape of Good Hope, but to which he proposed giving the title
of Cabo Tormentoso, or "Stormy Cape." King Jo&atilde;o, however,
recognising that Diaz's voyage had put the seal upon the expectations
<a name="page 100"><span class="page">Page 100</span></a>
with which Prince Henry had, seventy years before, started his
series of explorations, gave it the more auspicious name by which
it is now known.
</p>

<p class="indent">
For some reason which has not been adequately explained, no further
attempt was made for nearly ten years to carry out the final
consummation of Prince Henry's plan by sending out another expedition.
In the meantime, as we shall see, Columbus had left Portugal, after
a mean attempt had been made by the king to carry out his novel
plan of reaching India without his aid; and, as a just result,
the discovery of a western voyage to the Indies (as it was then
thought) had been successfully accomplished by Columbus, in the
service of the Catholic monarchs of Spain, in 1492. This would
naturally give pause to any attempt at reaching India by the more
cumbersome route of coasting along Africa, which had turned out
to be a longer process than Prince Henry had thought. Three years
after Columbus's discovery King Jo&atilde;o died, and his son and
successor Emmanuel did not take up the traditional Portuguese method
of reaching India till the third year of his reign.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By this time it had become clear, from Columbus's second voyage,
that there were more difficulties in the way of reaching the Indies
by his method than had been thought; and the year after his return
from his second voyage in 1496, King Emmanuel determined on once
more taking up the older method. He commissioned Vasco da Gama,
a gentleman of his court, to attempt the eastward route to
<a name="page 101"><span class="page">Page 101</span></a>
India with three vessels, carrying in all about sixty men. Already
by this time Columbus's bold venture into the unknown seas had
encouraged similar boldness in others, and instead of coasting down
the whole extent of the western coast of Africa, Da Gama steered
direct for Cape Verde Islands, and thence out into the ocean, till
he reached the Bay of St. Helena, a little to the north of the
Cape of Good Hope.
</p>

<p class="indent">
For a time he was baffled in his attempt to round the Cape by the
strong south-easterly winds, which blow there continually during
the summer season; but at last he commenced coasting along the
eastern shores of Africa, and at every suitable spot he landed
some of his sailors to make inquiries about Covilham and the court
of Prester John. But in every case he found the ports inhabited
by fanatical Moors, who, as soon as they discovered that their
visitors were Christians, attempted to destroy them, and refused
to supply them with pilots for the further voyage to India. This
happened at Mozambique, at Quiloa, and at Mombasa, and it was not
till he arrived at Melinda that he was enabled to obtain provisions
and a pilot, Malemo Cana, an Indian of Guzerat, who was quite familiar
with the voyage to Calicut. Under his guidance Gama's fleet went from
Melinda to Calicut in twenty-three days. Here the Zamorin, or sea-king,
displayed the same antipathy to his Christian visitors. The Mohammedan
traders of the place recognised at once the dangerous rivalry
<a name="page 102"><span class="page">Page 102</span></a>
which the visit of the Portuguese implied, with their monopoly
of the Eastern trade, and represented Gama and his followers as
merely pirates. Vasco, however, by his firm behaviour, managed
to evade the machinations of his trade rivals, and induced the
Zamorin to regard favourably an alliance with the Portuguese king.
Contenting himself with this result, he embarked again, and after
visiting Melinda, the only friendly spot he had found on the east
coast of Africa, he returned to Lisbon in September 1499, having
spent no less than two years on the voyage. King Emmanuel received
him with great favour, and appointed him Admiral of the Indies.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The significance of Vasco da Gama's voyage was at once seen by the
persons whose trade monopoly it threatened&mdash;the Venetians,
and the Sultan of Egypt. Priuli, the Venetian chronicler, reports:
"When this news reached Venice the whole city felt it greatly, and
remained stupefied, and the wisest held it as the worst news that
had ever arrived"&mdash;as indeed they might, for it prophesied
the downfall of the Venetian Empire. The Sultan of Egypt was equally
moved, for the greatest source of his riches was derived from the
duty of five per cent. which he levied on all merchandise entering
his dominions, and ten per cent. upon all goods exported from them.
Hitherto there had been all manner of bickerings between Venice and
Egypt, but this common danger brought them together. The Sultan
represented to Venice the need of
<a name="page 103"><span class="page">Page 103</span></a>
common action in order to drive away the new commerce; but Egypt
was without a navy, and had indeed no wood suitable for shipbuilding.
The Venetians took the trouble to transmit wood to Cairo, which was
then carried by camels to Suez, where a small fleet was prepared
to attack the Portuguese on their next visit to the Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Portuguese had in the meantime followed up Vasco da Gama's voyage
with another attempt, which was, in its way, even more important. In
1500 the king sent no less than thirteen ships under the command
of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, with Franciscans to convert, and twelve
hundred fighting men to overawe, the Moslems of the Indian Ocean. He
determined on steering even a more westerly course than Vasco da Gama,
and when he arrived in 17&deg; south of the line, he discovered land
which he took possession of in the name of Portugal, and named Santa
Cruz. The actual cross which he erected on this occasion is still
preserved in Brazil, for Cabral had touched upon the land now known
by that name. It is true that one of Columbus's companions, Pinzon,
had already touched upon the coast of Brazil before Cabral, but it
is evident from his experience that, even apart from Columbus, the
Portuguese would have discovered the New World sooner or later. It
is, however, to be observed that in stating this, as all historians
do, they leave out of account the fact that, but for Columbus, sailors
would still have continued the old course of coasting along
<a name="page 104"><span class="page">Page 104</span></a>
the shore, by which they would never have left the Old World. Cabral
lost several of his ships and many of his men, and, though he brought
home a rich cargo, was not regarded as successful, and Vasco da
Gama was again sent out with a large fleet in 1502, with which
he conquered the Zamorin of Calicut and obtained rich treasures.
In subsidiary voyages the Portuguese navigators discovered the
islands of St. Helena, Ascension, the Seychelles, Socotra, Tristan
da Cunha, the Maldives, and Madagascar.

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile King Emmanuel was adopting the Venetian method of
colonisation, which consisted in sending a Vice-Doge to each of
its colonies for a term of two years, during which his duty was to
encourage trade and to collect tribute. In a similar way, Emmanuel
appointed a Viceroy for his Eastern trade, and in 1505 Almeida
had settled in Ceylon, with a view to monopolising the cinnamon
trade of that place.

PORTUGUESE INDIES

</div>

<p class="indent">
But the greatest of the Portuguese viceroys was Affonso de Albuquerque,
who captured the important post of Goa, on the mainland of India,
which still belongs to Portugal, and the port of Ormuz, which,
we have seen, was one of the centres of the Eastern trade. Even
more important was the capture of the Moluccas, or Spice Islands,
which were discovered in 1511, after the Portuguese had seized
Malacca. By 1521 the Portuguese had full possession of the Spice
Islands, and thus held the trade of condiments entirely in their
own hands. The
<a name="page 106"><span class="page">Page 106</span></a>
result was seen soon in the rise of prices in the European markets.
Whereas at the end of the fifteenth century pepper, for instance,
was about 17s. a pound, from 1521 and onwards its average price
grew to be 25s., and so with almost all the ingredients by which
food could be made more tasty. One of the circumstances, however,
which threw the monopoly into the hands of the Portuguese was the
seizure of Egypt in 1521 by the Turks under Selim I., which would
naturally derange the course of trade from its old route through
Alexandria. From the Moluccas easy access was found to China, and
ultimately to Japan, so that the Portuguese for a time held in
their hands the whole of the Eastern trade, on which Europe depended
for most of its luxuries.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As we shall see, the Portuguese only won by a neck&mdash;if we
may use a sporting expression&mdash;in the race for the possession
of the Spice Islands. In the very year they obtained possession
of them, Magellan, on his way round the world, had reached the
Philippines, within a few hundred miles of them, and his ship,
the <i>Victoria</i>, actually sailed through them that year. In
fact, 1521 is a critical year in the discovery of the world, for
both the Spanish and Portuguese (the two nations who had attempted
to reach the Indies eastward and westward) arrived at the goal of
their desires, the Spice Islands, in that same year, while the
closure of Egypt to commerce occurred opportunely to divert the
trade into the hands of the Portuguese. Finally, the year 1521
was signalised by the death of
<a name="page 107"><span class="page">Page 107</span></a>
King Emmanuel of Portugal, under whose auspices the work of Prince
Henry the Navigator was completed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must here be observed that we are again anticipating matters. As
soon as the discovery of the New World was announced, the Pope was
appealed to, to determine the relative shares of Spain and Portugal
in the discoveries which would clearly follow upon Columbus's voyage.
By his Bull, dated 4th May 1493, Alexander VI. granted all discoveries
to the west to Spain, leaving it to be understood that all to the
east belonged to Portugal. The line of demarcation was an imaginary
one drawn from pole to pole, and passing one hundred leagues west
of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, which were supposed, in the
inaccurate geography of the time, to be in the same meridian. In
the following year the Portuguese monarch applied for a revision
of the <i>raya</i>, as this would keep him out of all discovered
in the New World altogether; and the line of demarcation was then
shifted 270 leagues westward, or altogether 1110 miles west of the
Cape Verdes. By a curious coincidence, within six years Cabral had
discovered Brazil, which fell within the angle thus cut off by the
<i>raya</i> from South America. Or was it entirely a coincidence?
May not Cabral have been directed to take this unusually westward
course in order to ascertain if any land fell within the Portuguese
claims? When, however, the Spice Islands were discovered, it remained
to be discussed whether the line
<a name="page 108"><span class="page">Page 108</span></a>
of demarcation, when continued on the other side of the globe,
brought them within the Spanish or Portuguese "sphere of influence,"
as we should say nowadays. By a curious chance they happened to be
very near the line, and, with the inaccurate maps of the period,
a pretty subject of quarrel was afforded between the Portuguese and
Spanish commissioners who met at Badajos to determine the question.
This was left undecided by the Junta, but by a family compact, in
1529, Charles V. ceded to his brother-in-law, the King of Portugal,
any rights he might have to the Moluccas, for the sum of 350,000
gold ducats, while he himself retained the Philippines, which have
been Spanish ever since.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By this means the Indian Ocean became, for all trade purposes, a
Portuguese lake throughout the sixteenth century, as will be seen
from the preceding map, showing the trading stations of the Portuguese
all along the shores of the ocean. But they only possessed their
monopoly for fifty years, for in 1580 the Spanish and Portuguese
crowns became united on the head of Philip II., and by the time
Portugal recovered its independence, in 1640, serious rivals had
arisen to compete with her and Spain for the monopoly of the Eastern
trade.

CHAPTER VII
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
TO THE INDIES WESTWARD&mdash;THE SPANISH ROUTE&mdash;COLUMBUS AND
MAGELLAN
</p>

<p class="indent">
While the Portuguese had, with slow persistency, devoted nearly a
century to carrying out Prince Henry's idea of reaching the Indies
by the eastward route, a bold yet simple idea had seized upon a
Genoese sailor, which was intended to achieve the same purpose by
sailing westward. The ancients, as we have seen, had recognised
the rotundity of the earth, and Eratosthenes had even recognised
the possibility of reaching India by sailing westward. Certain
traditions of the Greeks and the Irish had placed mysterious islands
far out to the west in the Atlantic, and the great philosopher
Plato had imagined a country named Atlantis, far out in the Indian
Ocean, where men were provided with all the gifts of nature. These
views of the ancients came once more to the attention of the learned,
owing to the invention of printing and the revival of learning,
when the Greek masterpieces began to be made accessible in Latin,
chiefly by fugitive Greeks from Constantinople, which had been
taken by the Turks in 1453. Ptolemy's geography was
<a name="page 110"><span class="page">Page 110</span></a>
printed at Rome in 1462, and with maps in 1478. But even without
the maps the calculation which he had made of the length of the
known world tended to shorten the distance between Portugal and
Farther India by 2500 miles. Since his time the travels of Marco
Polo had added to the knowledge of Europe the vast extent of Cathay
and the distant islands of Zipangu (Japan), which would again reduce
the distance by another 1500 miles. As the Greek geographers had
somewhat under-estimated the whole circuit of the globe, it would
thus seem that Zipangu was not more than 4000 miles to the west
of Portugal. As the Azores were considered to be much farther off
from the coast than they really were, it might easily seem, to an
enthusiastic mind, that Farther India might be reached when 3000
miles of the ocean had been traversed.

TOSCANELLI'S MAP (<i>restored</i>)
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
This was the notion that seized the mind of Christopher Columbus,
born at Genoa in 1446, of humble parentage, his father being a
weaver. He seems to have obtained sufficient knowledge to enable
him to study the works of the learned, and of the ancients in Latin
translations. But in his early years he devoted his attention to
obtaining a practical acquaintance with seamanship. In his day, as
we have seen, Portugal was the centre of geographical knowledge,
and he and his brother Bartolomeo, after many voyages north and
south, settled at last in Lisbon&mdash;his brother as a map-maker,
and himself as a practical seaman. This was about the year 1473,
and shortly afterwards he married
<a name="page 112"><span class="page">Page 112</span></a>
Felipa Mo&ntilde;iz, daughter of Bartolomeo Perestrello, an Italian
in the service of the King of Portugal, and for some time Governor
of Madeira.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now it chanced just at this time that there was a rumour in Portugal
that a certain Italian philosopher, named Toscanelli, had put forth
views as to the possibility of a westward voyage to Cathay, or
China, and the Portuguese king had, through a monk named Martinez,
applied to Toscanelli to know his views, which were given in a letter
dated 25th June 1474. It would appear that, quite independently,
Columbus had heard the rumour, and applied to Toscanelli, for in
the latter's reply he, like a good business man, shortened his
answer by giving a copy of the letter he had recently written to
Martinez. What was more important and more useful, Toscanelli sent
a map showing in hours (or degrees) the probable distance between
Spain and Cathay westward. By adding the information given by Marco
Polo to the incorrect views of Ptolemy about the breadth of the
inhabited world, Toscanelli reduced the distance from the Azores to
52&deg;, or 3120 miles. Columbus always expressed his indebtedness
to Toscanelli's map for his guidance, and, as we shall see, depended
upon it very closely, both in steering, and in estimating the distance
to be traversed. Unfortunately this map has been lost, but from
a list of geographical positions, with latitude and longitude,
founded upon it, modern geographers have been able to restore it
in some detail, and a simplified
<a name="page 113"><span class="page">Page 113</span></a>
sketch of it may be here inserted, as perhaps the most important
document in Columbus's career.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Certainly, whether he had the idea of reaching the Indies by a
westward voyage before or not, he adopted Toscanelli's views with
enthusiasm, and devoted his whole life henceforth to trying to
carry them into operation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
He gathered together all the information he could get about the
fabled islands of the Atlantic&mdash;the Island of St. Brandan, where
that Irish saint found happy mortals; and the Island of Antilla,
imagined by others, with its seven cities. He gathered together all
the gossip he could hear&mdash;of mysterious corpses cast ashore
on the Canaries, and resembling no race of men known to Europe;
of huge canes, found on the shores of the same islands, evidently
carved by man's skill. Curiously enough, these pieces of evidence
were logically rather against the existence of a westward route to
the Indies than not, since they indicated an unknown race, but,
to an enthusiastic mind like Columbus's, anything helped to confirm
him in his fixed idea, and besides, he could always reply that
these material signs were from the unknown island of Zipangu, which
Marco Polo had described as at some distance from the shores of
Cathay.
</p>

<p class="indent">
He first approached, as was natural, the King of Portugal, in whose
land he was living, and whose traditional policy was directed to
maritime exploration. But the Portuguese had for half a century been
pursuing another method of reaching India, and were not inclined to
<a name="page 114"><span class="page">Page 114</span></a>
take up the novel idea of a stranger, which would traverse their
long-continued policy of coasting down Africa. A hearing, however,
was given to him, but the report was unfavourable, and Columbus had
to turn his eyes elsewhere. There is a tradition that the Portuguese
monarch and his advisers thought rather more of Columbus's ideas
at first; and attempted secretly to put them into execution; but
the pilot to whom they entrusted the proposed voyage lost heart
as soon as he lost sight of land, and returned with an adverse
verdict on the scheme. It is not known whether Columbus heard of
this mean attempt to forestall him, but we find him in 1487 being
assisted by the Spanish Court, and from that time for the next
five years he was occupied in attempting to induce the Catholic
monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, to allow him to try his
novel plan of reaching the Indies. The final operations in expelling
the Moors from Spain just then engrossed all their attention and
all their capital, and Columbus was reduced to despair, and was
about to give up all hopes of succeeding in Spain, when one of
the great financiers, a converted Jew named Luis de Santaguel,
offered to find means for the voyage, and Columbus was recalled.

BEHAIM'S GLOBE. 1492.
</a>
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
On the 19th April 1492 articles were signed, by which Columbus
received from the Spanish monarchs the titles of Admiral and Viceroy
of all the lands he might discover, as well as one-tenth of all
the tribute to be derived from them; and on Friday the 3rd August,
<a name="page 116"><span class="page">Page 116</span></a>
of the same year, he set sail in three vessels, entitled the <i>Santa
Maria</i> (the flagship), the <i>Pinta</i>, and the <i>Nina</i>.
He started from the port of Palos, first for the Canary Islands.
These he left on the 6th September, and steered due west. On the
13th of that month, Columbus observed that the needle of the compass
pointed due north, and thus drew attention to the variability of
the compass. By the 21st September his men became mutinous and
tried to force him to return. He induced them to continue, and
four days afterwards the cry of "Land! land!" was heard, which
kept up their spirits for several days, till, on the 1st October,
large numbers of birds were seen. By that time Columbus had reckoned
that he had gone some 710 leagues from the Canaries, and if Zipangu
were in the position that Tostanelli's map gave it, he ought to
have been in its neighbourhood. It was reckoned in those days that
a ship on an average could make four knots an hour, dead reckoning,
which would give about 100 miles a day, so that Columbus might
reckon on passing over the 3100 miles which he thought intervened
between the Azores and Japan in about thirty-three days. All through
the early days of October his courage was kept up by various signs
of the nearness of land&mdash;birds and branches&mdash;while on
the 11th October, at sunset, they sounded, and found bottom; and
at ten o'clock, Columbus, sitting in the stern of his vessel, saw
a light, the first sure sign of land after thirty-five days, and
in near enough
<a name="page 117"><span class="page">Page 117</span></a>
approximation to Columbus's reckoning to confirm him in the impression
that he was approaching the mysterious land of Zipangu. Next morning
they landed on an island, called by the natives Guanahain, and by
Columbus San Salvador. This has been identified as Watling Island.
His first inquiry was as to the origin of the little plates of gold
which he saw in the ears of the natives. They replied that they
came from the West&mdash;another confirmation of his impression.
Steering westward, they arrived at Cuba, and afterwards at Hayti
(St. Domingo). Here, however, the <i>Santa Maria</i> sank, and
Columbus determined to return, to bring the good news, after leaving
some of his men in a fort at Hayti. The return journey was made in
the <i>Nina</i> in even shorter time to the Azores, but afterwards
severe storms arose, and it was not till the 15th March 1493 that he
reached Palos, after an absence of seven and a half months, during
which everybody thought that he and his ships had disappeared.
</p>

<p class="indent">
He was naturally received with great enthusiasm by the Spaniards,
and after a solemn entry at Barcelona he presented to Ferdinand
and Isabella the store of gold and curiosities carried by some
of the natives of the islands he had visited. They immediately
set about fitting out a much larger fleet of seven vessels, which
started from Cadiz, 25th September 1493. He took a more southerly
course, but again reached the islands now known as the West Indies.
On visiting Hayti he found the fort destroyed, and no traces of
the men he had left
<a name="page 118"><span class="page">Page 118</span></a>
there. It is needless for our purposes to go through the miserable
squabbles which occurred on this and his subsequent voyages, which
resulted in Columbus's return to Spain in chains and disgrace.
It is only necessary for us to say that in his third voyage, in
1498, he touched on Trinidad, and saw the coast of South America,
which he supposed to be the region of the Terrestrial Paradise.
This was placed by the medi&aelig;val maps at the extreme east of
the Old World. Only on his fourth voyage, in 1502, did he actually
touch the mainland, coasting along the shores of Central America
in the neighbourhood of Panama. After many disappointments, he
died, 20th May 1506, at Valladolid, believing, as far as we can
judge, to the day of his death, that what he had discovered was
what he set out to seek&mdash;a westward route to the Indies, though
his proud epitaph indicates the contrary:&mdash;

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 1: Columbus's Spanish name was Cristoval Colon.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
To this day his error is enshrined in the name we give to the Windward
and Antilles Islands&mdash;West Indies: in other words, the Indies
reached by the westward route. If they had been the Indies at all,
they would have been the most easterly of them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even if Columbus had discovered a new route to Farther India, he
could not, as we have seen, claim the merit of having originated
<a name="page 119"><span class="page">Page 119</span></a>
the idea, which, even in detail, he had taken from Toscanelli.
But his claim is even a greater one. He it was who first dared
to traverse unknown seas without coasting along the land, and his
example was the immediate cause of all the remarkable discoveries
that followed his earlier voyages. As we have seen, both Vasco da
Gama and Cabral immediately after departed from the slow coasting
route, and were by that means enabled to carry out to the full
the ideas of Prince Henry; but whereas, by the Portuguese method
of coasting, it had taken nearly a century to reach the Cape of
Good Hope, within thirty years of Columbus's first venture the
whole globe had been circumnavigated.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The first aim of his successors was to ascertain more clearly what it
was that Columbus had discovered. Immediately after Columbus's third,
voyage, in 1498, and after the news of Vasco da Gama's successful
passage to the Indies had made it necessary to discover some strait
leading from the "West Indies" to India itself, a Spanish gentleman,
named Hojeda, fitted out an expedition at his own expense, with
an Italian pilot on board, named Amerigo Vespucci, and tried once
more to find a strait to India near Trinidad. They were, of course,
unsuccessful, but they coasted along and landed on the north coast
of South America, which, from certain resemblances, they termed
Little Venice (Venezuela). Next year, as we have seen, Cabral,
in following Vasco da Gama, hit upon Brazil, which turned out to
be within the Portuguese
<a name="page 120"><span class="page">Page 120</span></a>
"sphere of influence," as determined by the line of demarcation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But, three months previous to Cabral's touching upon Brazil, one of
Columbus's companions on his first voyage, Vincenta Yanez Pinzon,
had touched on the coast of Brazil, eight degrees south of the
line, and from there had worked northward, seeking for a passage
which would lead west to the Indies. He discovered the mouth of
the Amazon, but, losing two of his vessels, returned to Palos,
which he reached in September 1500.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This discovery of an unknown and unsuspected continent so far south
of the line created great interest, and shortly after Cabral's
return Amerigo Vespucci was sent out in 1501 by the King of Portugal
as pilot of a fleet which should explore the new land discovered
by Cabral and claim it for the Crown of Portugal. His instructions
were to ascertain how much of it was within the line of demarcation.
Vespucci reached the Brazilian coast at Cape St. Roque, and then
explored it very thoroughly right down to the river La Plata, which
was too far west to come within the Portuguese sphere. Amerigo
and his companions struck out south-eastward till they reached
the island of St. Georgia, 1200 miles east of Cape Horn, where
the cold and the floating ice drove them back, and they returned
to Lisbon, after having gone farthest south up to their time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This voyage of Amerigo threw a new light upon the nature of the
discovery made by Columbus. Whereas he had thought he had discovered
<a name="page 121"><span class="page">Page 121</span></a>
a route to India and had touched upon Farther India, Amerigo and his
companions had shown that there was a hitherto unsuspected land
intervening between Columbus's discoveries and the long-desired Spice

</span>
</span>

Islands of Farther India. Amerigo, in describing his discoveries,
ventured so far as to suggest that they constituted a New World;
and a German professor, named Martin
<a name="page 122"><span class="page">Page 122</span></a>
Waldseem&uuml;ller, who wrote an introduction to Cosmography in
1506, which included an account of Amerigo's discoveries, suggested
that this New World should be called after him, AMERICA, after the
analogy of Asia, Africa, and Europe. For a long time the continent
which we now know as South America was called simply the New World,
and was supposed to be joined on to the east coast of Asia. The
name America was sometimes applied to it&mdash;not altogether
inappropriately, since it was Amerigo's voyage which definitely
settled that really new lands had been discovered by the western
route; and when it was further ascertained that this new land was
joined, not to Asia, but to another continent as large as itself,
the two new lands were distinguished as North and South America.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It was, at any rate, clear from Amerigo's discovery that the westward
route to the Spice Islands would have to be through or round this
New World discovered by him, and a Portuguese noble, named Fernao
Magelhaens, was destined to discover the practicability of this
route. He had served his native country under Almeida and Albuquerque
in the East Indies, and was present at the capture of Malacca in
1511, and from that port was despatched by Albuquerque with three
ships to visit the far-famed Spice Islands. They visited Amboyna
and Banda, and learned enough of the abundance and cheapness of
the spices of the islands to recognise their importance; but under
the direction of Albuquerque, who only sent them
<a name="page 123"><span class="page">Page 123</span></a>
out on an exploring expedition, they returned to him, leaving behind
them, however, one of Magelhaens' greatest friends, Francisco Serrao,
who settled in Ternate and from time to time sent glowing accounts of
the Moluccas to his friend Magelhaens. He in the meantime returned
to Portugal, and was employed on an expedition to Morocco. He was
not, however, well treated by the Portuguese monarch, and determined
to leave his service for that of Charles V., though he made it
a condition of his entering his service that he should make no
discoveries within the boundaries of the King of Portugal, and do
nothing prejudicial to his interests.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This was in the year 1517, and two years elapsed before Magelhaens
started on his celebrated voyage. He had represented to the Emperor
that he was convinced that a strait existed which would lead into
the Indian Ocean, past the New World of Amerigo, and that the Spice
Islands were beyond the line of demarcation and within the Spanish
sphere of influence. There is some evidence that Spanish merchant
vessels, trading secretly to obtain Brazil wood, had already caught
sight of the strait afterwards named after Magelhaens, and certainly
such a strait is represented upon Schoner's globes dated 1515 and
1520&mdash;earlier than Magelhaens' discovery. The Portuguese were
fully aware of the dangers threatened to their monopoly of the spice
trade&mdash;which by this time had been firmly established&mdash;owing
to the presence of Serrao in Ternate, and did all in their power
to dissuade Charles from
<a name="page 124"><span class="page">Page 124</span></a>
sending out the threatened expedition, pointing out that they would
consider it an unfriendly act if such an expedition were permitted
to start. Notwithstanding this the Emperor persisted in the project,
and on Tuesday, 20th September 1519, a fleet of five vessels, the
<i>Trinidad, St. Antonio, Concepcion, Victoria</i>, and <i>St.
Jago</i>, manned by a heterogeneous collection of Spaniards, Portuguese,
Basques, Genoese, Sicilians, French, Flemings, Germans, Greeks,
Neapolitans, Corfiotes, Negroes, Malays, and a single Englishman
(Master Andrew of Bristol), started from Seville upon perhaps the
most important voyage of discovery ever made. So great was the
antipathy between Spanish and Portuguese that disaffection broke
out almost from the start, and after the mouth of the La Plata
had been carefully explored, to ascertain whether this was not
really the beginning of a passage through the New World, a mutiny
broke out on the 2nd April 1520, in Port St. Julian, where it had
been determined to winter; for of course by this time the sailors
had become aware that the time of the seasons was reversed in the
Southern Hemisphere. Magelhaens showed great firmness and skill in
dealing with the mutiny; its chief leaders were either executed or
marooned, and on the 18th October he resumed his voyage. Meanwhile
the habits and customs of the natives had been observed&mdash;their
huge height and uncouth foot-coverings, for which Magelhaens gave
them the name of Patagonians. Within three days they had arrived
at the entrance of
<a name="page 125"><span class="page">Page 125</span></a>
the passage which still bears Magelhaens' name. By this time one of
the ships, the <i>St Jago</i>, had been lost, and it was with only
four of his vessels&mdash;the <i>Trinidad</i>, the <i>Victoria</i>, the
<i>Concepcion</i>. and the <i>St. Antonio</i>&mdash;that, Magelhaens

began his passage. There are many twists and divisions in the strait,
and on arriving at one of the partings, Magelhaens despatched the
<i>St. Antonio</i> to explore it, while he proceeded with the other
three ships along the more direct route. The pilot of the <i>St.
Antonio</i>
<a name="page 126"><span class="page">Page 126</span></a>
had been one of the mutineers, and persuaded the crew to seize this
opportunity to turn back altogether; so that when Magelhaens arrived
at the appointed place of junction, no news could be ascertained of
the missing vessel; it went straight back to Portugal. Magelhaens
determined to continue his search, even, he said, if it came to
eating the leather thongs of the sails. It had taken him thirty-eight
days to get through the Straits, and for four months afterwards
Magelhaens continued his course through the ocean, which, from
its calmness, he called Pacific; taking a north-westerly course,
and thus, by a curious chance, only hitting upon a couple of small
uninhabited islands throughout their whole voyage, through a sea
which we now know to be dotted by innumerable inhabited islands.
On the 6th March 1520 they had sighted the Ladrones, and obtained
much-needed provisions. Scurvy had broken out in its severest form,
and the only Englishman on the ships died at the Ladrones. From
there they went on to the islands now known as the Philippines,
one of the kings of which greeted them very favourably. As a reward
Magelhaens undertook one of his local quarrels, and fell in an
unequal fight at Mactan, 27th April 1521. The three vessels continued
their course for the Moluccas, but the <i>Concepcion</i> proved
so unseaworthy that they had to beach and burn her. They reached
Borneo, and here Juan Sebastian del Cano was appointed captain
of the <i>Victoria</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At last, on the 6th November 1521, they
<a name="page 127"><span class="page">Page 127</span></a>
reached the goal of their journey, and anchored at Tidor, one of the
Moluccas. They traded on very advantageous terms with the natives,
and filled their holds with the spices and nutmegs for which they had
journeyed so far; but when they attempted to resume their journey
homeward, it was found that the <i>Trinidad</i> was too unseaworthy
to proceed at once, and it was decided that the <i>Victoria</i>
should start so as to get the east monsoon. This she did, and after
the usual journey round the Cape of Good Hope, arrived off the
Mole of Seville on Monday the 8th September 1522&mdash;three years
all but twelve days from the date of their departure from Spain.
Of the two hundred and seventy men who had started with the fleet,
only eighteen returned in the <i>Victoria</i>. According to the
ship's reckoning they had arrived on Sunday the 7th, and for some
time it was a puzzle to account for the day thus lost.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile the <i>Trinidad</i>, which had been left behind at the
Moluccas, had attempted to sail back to Panama, and reached as
far north as 43&deg;, somewhere about longitude 175&deg; W. Here
provisions failed them, and they had to return to the Moluccas, where
they were seized, practically as pirates, by a fleet of Portuguese
vessels sent specially to prevent interference by the Spaniards
with the Portuguese monopoly of the spice trade. The crew of the
<i>Trinidad</i> were seized and made prisoners, and ultimately only
four of them reached Spain again, after many adventures. Thirteen
others, who had landed at the Cape de Verde Islands
<a name="page 128"><span class="page">Page 128</span></a>
from the <i>Victoria</i>, may also be included among the survivors
of the fleet, so that a total number of thirty-five out of two
hundred and seventy sums up the number of the first circumnavigators
of the globe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The importance of this voyage was unique when regarded from the
point of view of geographical discovery. It decisively clinched
the matter with regard to the existence of an entirely New World
independent from Asia. In particular, the backward voyage of the
<i>Trinidad</i> (which has rarely been noticed) had shown that
there was a wide expanse of ocean north of the line and east of
Asia, whilst the previous voyage had shown the enormous extent
of sea south of the line. After the circumnavigation of the
<i>Victoria</i> it was clear to cosmographers that the world was
much larger than had been imagined by the ancients; or rather,
perhaps one may say that Asia was smaller than had been thought
by the medi&aelig;val writers. The dogged persistence shown by
Magelhaens in carrying out his idea, which turned out to be a perfectly
justifiable one, raises him from this point of view to a greater
height than Columbus, whose month's voyage brought him exactly
where he thought he would find land according to Toscanelli's map.
After Magelhaens, as will be seen, the whole coast lines of the
world were roughly known, except for the Arctic Circle and for
Australia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Emperor was naturally delighted with the result of the voyage.
He granted Del Cano a pension, and a coat of arms commemorating

his services. The terms of the grant are very significant: <i>or</i>,
two cinnamon sticks <i>saltire proper</i>, three nutmegs and twelve
<a name="page 130"><span class="page">Page 130</span></a>
cloves, a chief <i>gules</i>, a castle <i>or; crest</i>, a globe,
bearing the motto, "Primus circumdedisti me" (thou wert the first
to go round me); <i>supporters</i>, two Malay kings crowned, holding
in the exterior hand a spice branch proper. The castle, of course,
refers to Castile, but the rest of the blazon indicates the importance
attributed to the voyage as resting mainly upon the visit to the
Spice Islands. As we have already seen, however, the Portuguese
recovered their position in the Moluccas immediately after the
departure of the <i>Victoria</i>, and seven years later Charles
V. gave up any claims he might possess through Magelhaens' visit.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But for a long time afterwards the Spaniards still cast longing
eyes upon the Spice Islands, and the Fuggers, the great bankers
of Augsburg, who financed the Spanish monarch, for a long time
attempted to get possession of Peru, with the scarcely disguised
object of making it a "jumping-place" from which to make a fresh
attempt at obtaining possession of the Moluccas. A modern parallel
will doubtless occur to the reader.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are thus three stages to be distinguished in the successive
discovery and delimitation of the New World:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="indent">
(i.) At first Columbus imagined that he had actually reached Zipangu
or Japan, and achieved the object of his voyage.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(ii.) Then Amerigo Vespucci, by coasting down South America, ascertained
that there was a huge unknown land intervening even
<a name="page 131"><span class="page">Page 131</span></a>
between Columbus' discoveries and the long-desired Spice Islands.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(iii.) Magelhaens clinches this view by traversing the Southern
Pacific for thousands of miles before reaching the Moluccas.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is still a fourth stage by which it was gradually discovered
that the North-west of America was not joined on to Asia, but this
stage was only gradually reached and finally determined by the
voyages of Behring and Cook.

CHAPTER VIII
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
TO THE INDIES NORTHWARD&mdash;ENGLISH, FRENCH, DUTCH, AND RUSSIAN
ROUTES
</p>

<p class="indent">
The discovery of the New World had the most important consequences
on the relative importance of the different nations of Europe.
Hitherto the chief centres for over two thousand years had been
round the shores of the Mediterranean, and, as we have seen, Venice,
by her central position and extensive trade to the East, had become
a world-centre during the latter Middle Ages. But after Columbus,
and still more after Magelhaens, the European nations on the Atlantic
were found to be closer to the New World, and, in a measure, closer
to the Spice Islands, which they could reach all the way by ship,
instead of having to pay expensive land freights. The trade routes
through Germany became at once neglected, and it is only in the
present century that she has at all recovered from the blow given
to her by the discovery of the new sea routes in which she could
not join. But to England, France, and the Low Countries the new
outlook promised a share in the world's trade and affairs generally,
which they had never
<a name="page 133"><span class="page">Page 133</span></a>
hitherto possessed while the Mediterranean was the centre of commerce.
If the Indies could be reached by sea, they were almost in as fortunate
a position as Portugal or Spain. Almost as soon as the new routes
were discovered the Northern nations attempted to utilise them,
notwithstanding the Bull of Partition, which the French king laughed
at, and the Protestant English and Dutch had no reason to respect.
Within three years of the return of Columbus from his first voyage,
Henry VII. employed John Cabot, a Venetian settled in Bristol,
with his three sons, to attempt the voyage to the Indies by the
North-West Passage. He appears to have re-discovered Newfoundland
in 1497, and then in the following year, failing to find a passage
there, coasted down North America nearly as far as Florida.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1534 Jacques Cartier examined the river St. Lawrence, and his
discoveries were later followed up by Samuel de Champlain, who
explored some of the great lakes near the St. Lawrence, and established
the French rule in Canada, or Acadie, as it was then called.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile the English had made an attempt to reach the Indies,
still by a northern passage, but this time in an easterly direction.
Sebastian Cabot, who had been appointed Grand Pilot of England by
Edward VI., directed a voyage of exploration in 1553, under Sir
Hugh Willoughby. Only one of these ships, with the pilot (Richard
Chancellor) on board, survived the voyage, reaching Archangel, and
then going
<a name="page 134"><span class="page">Page 134</span></a>
overland to Moscow, where he was favourably received by the Czar of
Russia, Ivan the Terrible. He was, however, drowned on his return,
and no further attempt to reach Cathay by sea was attempted.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The North-West Passage seemed thus to promise better than that by
the North-East, and in 1576 Martin Frobisher started on an exploring
voyage, after having had the honour of a wave of Elizabeth's hand
as he passed Greenwich. He reached Greenland, and then Labrador,
and, in a subsequent voyage next year, discovered the strait named
after him. His project was taken up by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, on
whom, with his brother Adrian, Elizabeth conferred the privilege of
making the passage to China and the Moluccas by the north-westward,
north-eastward, or northward route. At the same time a patent was
granted him for discovering any lands unsettled by Christian princes.
A settlement was made in St. John's, Newfoundland, but on the return
voyage, near the Azores, Sir Humphrey's "frigate" (a small boat
of ten men), disappeared, after he had been heard to call out,
"Courage, my lads; we are as near heaven by sea as by land!" This
happened in 1583.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Two years after, another expedition was sent out by the merchants
of London, under John Davis, who, on this and two subsequent voyages,
discovered several passages trending westward, which warranted the
hope of finding a northwest passage. Beside the strait named after
<a name="page 135"><span class="page">Page 135</span></a>
him, it is probable that on his third voyage, in 1587, he passed
through the passage now named after Hudson. His discoveries were not
followed up for some twenty years, when Henry Hudson was despatched
in 1607 with a crew of ten men and a boy. He reached Spitzbergen,
and reached 80&deg; N., and in the following year reached the North
(Magnetic) Pole, which was then situated at 75.22&deg; N. Two of
his men were also fortunate enough to see a mermaid&mdash;probably
an Eskimo woman in her <i>kayak</i>. In a third voyage, in 1609,
he discovered the strait and bay which now bear his name, but was
marooned by his crew, and never heard of further. He had previously,
for a time, passed into the service of the Dutch, and had guided
them to the river named after him, on which New York now stands. The
course of English discovery in the north was for a time concluded
by the voyage of William Baffin in 1615, which resulted in the
discovery of the land named after him, as well as many of the islands
to the north of America.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile the Dutch had taken part in the work of discovery towards
the north. They had revolted against the despotism of Philip II., who
was now monarch of both Spain and Portugal. At first they attempted
to adopt a route which would not bring them into collision with
their old masters; and in three voyages, between 1594 and 1597,
William Barentz attempted the North-East Passage, under the auspices
of the States-General. He discovered Cherry Island, and touched
on Spitzbergen,
<a name="page 136"><span class="page">Page 136</span></a>
but failed in the main object of his search; and the attention of
the Dutch was henceforth directed to seizing the Portuguese route,
rather than finding a new one for themselves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The reason they were able to do this is a curious instance of Nemesis
in history. Owing to the careful series of intermarriages planned
out by Ferdinand of Arragon, the Portuguese Crown and all its
possessions became joined to Spain in 1580 under Philip II., just
a year after the northern provinces of the Netherlands had renounced
allegiance to Spain. Consequently they were free to attack not alone
Spanish vessels and colonies, but also those previously belonging
to Portugal. As early as 1596 Cornelius Houtman rounded the Cape
and visited Sumatra and Bantam, and within fifty, years the Dutch
had replaced the Portuguese in many of their Eastern possessions.
In 1614 they took Malacca, and with it the command of the Spice
Islands; by 1658 they had secured full possession of Ceylon. Much
earlier, in 1619, they had founded Batavia in Java, which they made
the centre of their East Indian possessions, as it still remains.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The English at first attempted to imitate the Dutch in their East
Indian policy. The English East India Company was founded by Elizabeth
in 1600, and as early as 1619 had forced the Dutch to allow them to
take a third share of the profits of the Spice Islands. In order
to do this several English planters settled at Amboyna, but within
four years trade rivalries had reached such a pitch that the Dutch
murdered some of
<a name="page 137"><span class="page">Page 137</span></a>
these merchants and drove the rest from the islands. As a consequence
the English Company devoted its attention to the mainland of India
itself, where they soon obtained possession of Madras and Bombay,
and left the islands of the Indian Ocean mainly in possession of
the Dutch. We shall see later the effect of this upon the history
of geography, for it was owing to their possession of the East
India Islands that the Dutch were practically the discoverers of
Australia. One result of the Dutch East India policy has left its
traces even to the present day. In 1651 they established a colony
at the Cape of Good Hope, which only fell into English hands during
the Napoleonic wars, when Napoleon held Holland.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile the English had not lost sight of the possibilities of
the North-East Passage, if not for reaching the Spice Islands,
at any rate as a means of tapping the overland route to China,
hitherto monopolised by the Genoese. In 1558 an English gentleman,
named Anthony Jenkinson, was sent as ambassador to the Czar of
Muscovy, and travelled from Moscow as far as Bokhara; but he was
not very fortunate in his venture, and England had to be content
for some time to receive her Indian and Chinese goods from the
Venetian argosies as before. But at last they saw no reason why
they should not attempt direct relations with the East. A company of
Levant merchants was formed in 1583 to open out direct communications
with Aleppo, Bagdad, Ormuz, and Goa. They were unsuccessful at the
two latter
<a name="page 138"><span class="page">Page 138</span></a>
places owing to the jealousy of the Portuguese, but they made
arrangements for cheaper transit of Eastern goods to England, and
in 1587 the last of the Venetian argosies, a great vessel of eleven
hundred tons, was wrecked off the Isle of Wight. Henceforth the
English conducted their own business with the East, and Venetian
and Portuguese monopoly was at an end.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the journeys of Chancellor and Jenkinson to the Court of Moscow
had more far-reaching effects; the Russians themselves were thereby
led to contemplate utilising their proximity to one of the best
known routes to the Far East. Shortly after Jenkinson's visit, the
Czar, Ivan the Terrible, began extending his dominions eastward,
sending at first a number of troops to accompany the Russian merchant
Strogonof as far as the Obi in search of sables. Among the troops
were a corps of six thousand Cossacks commanded by one named Vassili
Yermak, who, finding the Tartars an easy prey, determined at first
to set up a new kingdom for himself. In 1579 he was successful in
overcoming the Tartars and their chief town Sibir, near Tobolsk;
but, finding it difficult to retain his position, determined to
return to his allegiance to the Czar on condition of being supported.
This was readily granted, and from that time onward the Russians
steadily pushed on through to the unknown country of the north
of Asia, since named after the little town conquered by Yermak,
of which scarcely any traces now remain. As early as 1639 they
had reached
<a name="page 139"><span class="page">Page 139</span></a>
the Pacific under Kupilof. A force was sent out from Yakutz, on
the Lena, in 1643, which reached the Amur, and thus Russians came
for the first time in contact with the Chinese, and a new method
of reaching Cathay was thus obtained, while geography gained the

</span>

knowledge of the extent of Northern Asia. For, about the same time
(in 1648), the Arctic Ocean was reached on the north shores of
Siberia, and a fleet under the Cossack Dishinef
<a name="page 140"><span class="page">Page 140</span></a>
sailed from Kolyma and reached as far as the straits known by the
name of Behring. It was not, however, till fifty years afterwards,
in 1696, that the Russians reached Kamtschatka.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Notwithstanding the access of knowledge which had been gained by
these successive bold pushes towards north and east, it still remained
uncertain whether Siberia did not join on to the northern part of
the New World discovered by Columbus and Amerigo, and in 1728 Peter
the Great sent out an expedition under VITUS BEHRING, a Dane in the
Russian service, with the express aim of ascertaining this point.
He reached Kamtschatka, and there built two vessels as directed
by the Czar, and started on his voyage northward, coasting along
the land. When he reached a little beyond 67&deg; N., he found
no land to the north or east, and conceived he had reached the
end of the continent. As a matter of fact, he was within thirty
miles of the west coast of America; but of this he does not seem
to have been aware, being content with solving the special problem
put before him by the Czar. The strait thus discovered by Behring,
though not known by him to be a strait, has ever since been known
by his name. In 1741, however, Behring again set out on a voyage
of discovery to ascertain how far to the east America was, and
within a fortnight had come within sight of the lofty mountain
named by him Mount St. Elias. Behring himself died upon this voyage,
on an island also named after him; he had at last solved
<a name="page 141"><span class="page">Page 141</span></a>
the relation between the Old and the New Worlds.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These voyages of Behring, however, belong to a much later stage
of discovery than those we have hitherto been treating for the
last three chapters. His explorations were undertaken mainly for
scientific purposes, and to solve a scientific problem, whereas
all the other researches of Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch
were directed to one end, that of reaching the Spice Islands and
Cathay. The Portuguese at first started out on the search by the
slow method of creeping down the coast of Africa; the Spanish, by
adopting Columbus's bold idea, had attempted it by the western
route, and under Magellan's still bolder conception had equally
succeeded in reaching it in that way; the English and French sought
for a north-west passage to the Moluccas; while the English and
Dutch attempted a northeasterly route. In both directions the icy
barrier of the north prevented success. It was reserved, as we shall
see, for the present century to complete the North-West Passage
under Maclure, and the North-East by Nordenskiold, sailing with
quite different motives to those which first brought the mariners
of England, France, and Holland within the Arctic Circle.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The net result of all these attempts by the nations of Europe to
wrest from the Venetians the monopoly of the Eastern trade was to
add to geography the knowledge of the existence of a New World
intervening between the
<a name="page 142"><span class="page">Page 142</span></a>
western shores of Europe and the eastern shores of Asia. We have
yet to learn the means by which the New World thus discovered became
explored and possessed by the European nations.

CHAPTER IX
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
THE PARTITION OF AMERICA
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have hitherto been dealing with the discoveries made by Spanish
and Portuguese along the coast of the New World, but early in the
sixteenth century they began to put foot on <i>terra firma</i>
and explore the interior. As early as 1513 Vasco Nunez de Balboa
ascended the highest peak in the range running from the Isthmus
of Panama, and saw for the first time by European eyes the great
ocean afterwards to be named by Magellan the Pacific. He there
heard that the country to the south extended without end, and was
inhabited by great nations, with an abundance of gold. Among his
companions who heard of this golden country, or El Dorado, was
one Francisco Pizarro, who was destined to test the report. But a
similar report had reached the ears of Diego Velasquez, governor
of Cuba, as to a great nation possessed of much gold to the north
of Darien. He accordingly despatched his lieutenant Hernando Cortes
in 1519 to investigate, with ten ships, six hundred and fifty men,
and some eighteen horses. When he landed at the port named by him
Vera Cruz, the appearance of his men, and more especially of his
horses, astonished and
<a name="page 144"><span class="page">Page 144</span></a>
alarmed the natives of Mexico, then a large and semi-civilised
state under the rule of Montezuma, the last representative of the
Aztecs, who in the twelfth century had succeeded the Toltecs, a
people that had settled on the Mexican tableland as early probably
as the seventh century, introducing the use of metals and roads
and many of the elements of civilisation. Montezuma is reported
to have been able to range no less than two hundred thousand men
under his banners, but he showed his opinion of the Spaniards by
sending them costly presents, gold and silver and costly stuffs.
This only aroused the cupidity of Cortes, who determined to make
a bold stroke for the conquest of such a rich prize. He burnt his
ships and advanced into the interior of the country, conquering
on his way the tribe of the Tlascalans, who had been at war with
the Mexicans, but, when conquered, were ready to assist him against
them. With their aid he succeeded in seizing the Mexican king, who
was forced to yield a huge tribute. After many struggles Cortes
found himself master of the capital, and of all the resources of the
Mexican Empire (1521). These he hastened to place at the feet of the
Emperor Charles V., who appointed him Governor and Captain-General
of Mexico. It is characteristic throughout the history of the New
World, that none of the soldiers of fortune who found it such an
easy prey ever thought of setting up an empire for himself. This
is a testimony to the influence national feeling had upon the minds
even of the most lawless, and the result was that Europe
<a name="page 145"><span class="page">Page 145</span></a>
and European ideas were brought over into America, or rather the
New World became tributary to Europe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As soon as Cortes had established himself he fitted out expeditions
to explore the country, and himself reached Honduras after a remarkable
journey for over 1000 miles, in which he was only guided by a map on
cotton cloth, on which the Cacique of Tabasco had painted all the
towns, rivers, and mountains of the country as far as Nicaragua. He
also despatched a small fleet under Alvarro de Saavedra to support
a Spanish expedition which had been sent to the Moluccas under
Sebastian del Cano, and which arrived at Tidor in 1527, to the
astonishment of Spanish and Portuguese alike when they heard he
had started from New Castile. In 1536, Cortes, who had been in
the meantime shorn of much of his power, conducted an expedition
by sea along the north-west coast of Mexico, and reached what he
considered to be a great island. He identified this with an imaginary
island in the Far East, near the terrestrial paradise to which
the name of California had been given in a contemporary romance.
Thus, owing to Cortes, almost the whole of Central America had
become known before his death in 1540. Similarly, at a much earlier
period, Ponce de Leon had thought he had discovered another great
island in Florida in 1512, whither he had gone in search of Bayuca, a
fabled island of the Indians, in which they stated was a fountain of
eternal youth. At the time of Cortes' first attempt on Mexico, Pineda
<a name="page 146"><span class="page">Page 146</span></a>
had coasted round Florida, and connected it with the rest of the
coast of Mexico, which he traversed as far as Vera Cruz.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The exploits of Cortes were all important in their effects. He had
proved with what ease a handful of men might overcome an empire and
gain unparalleled riches. Francisco Pizarro was encouraged by the
success of Cortes to attempt the discovery of the El Dorado he had
heard of when on Balboa's expedition. With a companion named Diego
de Almegro he made several coasting expeditions down the northwest
coast of South America, during which they heard of the empire of
the Incas on the plateau of Peru. They also obtained sufficient
gold and silver to raise their hopes of the riches of the country,
and returned to Spain to report to the Emperor. Pizarro obtained
permission from Charles V. to attempt the conquest of Peru, of which
he was named Governor and Captain-General, on condition of paying a
tribute of one-fifth of the treasure he might obtain. He started
in February 1531 with a small force of 180 men, of whom thirty-six
were horsemen. Adopting the policy of Cortes, he pushed directly
for the capital Cuzco, where they managed to seize Atahualpa, the
Inca of the time. He attempted to ransom himself by agreeing to
fill the room in which he was confined, twenty-two feet long by
sixteen wide, with bars of gold as high as the hand could reach.
He carried out this prodigious promise, and Pizarro's companions
found themselves in possession of booty equal to three millions
sterling.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 147"><span class="page">Page 147</span></a>
Atahualpa was, however, not released, but condemned to death on
a frivolous pretext, while Pizarro dismissed his followers, fully
confident that the wealth they carried off would attract as many
men as he could desire to El Dorado. He settled himself at Lima,
near the coast, in 1534. Meanwhile Almegro had been despatched
south, and made himself master of Chili. Another expedition in
1539 was conducted by Pizarro's brother Gonzales across the Andes,
and reached the sources of the Amazon, which one of his companions,
Francisco de Orellana, traversed as far as the mouth. This he reached
in August 1541, after a voyage of one thousand leagues. The river
was named after Orellana, but, from reports he made of the existence
of a tribe of female warriors, was afterwards known as the river
of the Amazons. The author spread reports of another El Dorado to
the north, in which the roofs of the temples were covered with
gold. This report afterwards led to the disastrous expedition of
Sir Walter Raleigh to Guiana. By his voyage Orellana connected the
Spanish and Portuguese "spheres of influence" in the New World of
Amerigo. By the year 1540 the main outlines of Central and South
America and something of the interior had been made known by the
Spanish adventurers within half a century of Columbus' first voyage.
Owing to the papal bull Portugal possessed Brazil, but all the
rest of the huge stretch of country was claimed for Spain. The
Portuguese wisely treated Brazil as an outlet for their overflowing
population, which settled there in
<a name="page 148"><span class="page">Page 148</span></a>
large numbers and established plantations. The Spaniards, on the
other hand, only regarded their huge possessions as exclusive markets
to be merely visited by them. Rich mines of gold, silver, and mercury
were discovered in Mexico and Peru, especially in the far-famed
mines of Potosi, and these were exploited entirely in the interests
of Spain, which acted as a sieve by which the precious metals were
poured into Europe, raising prices throughout the Old World. In
return European merchandise was sent in the return voyages of the
Spanish galleons to New Spain, which could only buy Flemish cloth,
for example, through Spanish intermediaries, who raised its price
to three times the original cost. This short-sighted policy on
the part of Spain naturally encouraged smuggling, and attracted
the ships of all nations towards that pursuit.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have already seen the first attempts of the French and English
in the exploration of the north-east coast of North America; but
during the sixteenth century very little was done to settle on
such inhospitable shores, which did not offer anything like the
rich prizes that Tropical America afforded. Neither the exploration
of Cartier in 1534, or that of the Cabots much earlier, was followed
by any attempt to possess the land. Breton fishermen visited the
fisheries off Newfoundland, and various explorers attempted to find
openings which would give them a north-west passage, but otherwise
the more northerly part of the continent was left unoccupied till
the beginning
<a name="page 149"><span class="page">Page 149</span></a>
of the seventeenth century. The first town founded was that of
St. Augustine, in Florida, in 1565, but this was destroyed three
years later by a French expedition. Sir Walter Raleigh attempted
to found a colony in 1584 near where Virginia now stands, but it
failed after three years, and it was not till the reign of James
I. that an organised attempt was made by England to establish
plantations, as they were then called, on the North American coast.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Two Chartered Companies, the one to the north named the Plymouth
Company, and the one to the south named the London Company (both
founded in 1606), nominally divided between them all the coast
from Nova Scotia to Florida. These large tracts of country were
during the seventeenth century slowly parcelled out into smaller
states, mainly Puritan in the north (New England), High Church
and Catholic in the south (Virginia and Maryland). But between the
two, and on the banks of the Hudson and the Delaware, two other
European nations had also formed plantations&mdash;the Dutch along
the Hudson from 1609 forming the New Netherlands, and the Swedes
from 1636 along the Delaware forming New Sweden. The latter, however,
lasted only a few years, and was absorbed by the Dutch in 1655. The
capital of New Netherlands was established on Manhattan Island, to
the south of the palisade still known as Wall Street, and the city
was named New Amsterdam. The Hudson is such an important artery
of commerce between the Atlantic and the great lakes, that
<a name="page 150"><span class="page">Page 150</span></a>
this wedge between the two sets of English colonies would have
been a bar to any future progress. This was recognised by Charles
II., who in 1664 despatched an expedition to demand its surrender,
even though England and Holland were at that time at peace. New
Amsterdam was taken, and named New York, after the king's brother,
the Duke of York, afterwards James II. New Sweden, which at the
same time fell into the English hands, was sold as a proprietary
plantation to a Jersey man, Sir George Carteret, and to a Quaker,
William Penn. By this somewhat high-handed procedure the whole
coast-line down to Florida was in English hands.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both the London and Plymouth Companies had started to form plantations
in 1607, and in that very year the French made their first effective
settlements in America, at Port Royal and at Nova Scotia, then
called Arcadie; while, the following year, Samuel de Champlain
made settlements at Quebec, and founded French Canada. He explored
the lake country, and established settlements down the banks of the
St. Lawrence, along which French activity for a long time confined
itself. Between the French and the English settlements roved the
warlike Five Nations of the Iroquois Indians, and Champlain, whose
settlements were in the country of the Algonquins, was obliged
to take their part and make the Iroquois the enemies of France,
which had important effects upon the final struggle between England
and France in the eighteenth century. The French continued
<a name="page 151"><span class="page">Page 151</span></a>
their exploration of the interior of the continent. In 1673 Marquette
discovered the Mississippi (Missi Sepe, "the great water"), and
descended it as far as the mouth of the Arkansas, but the work of
exploring the Mississippi valley was undertaken by Robert de la
Salle. He had already discovered the Ohio and Illinois rivers, and
in three expeditions, between 1680 and 1682, succeeded in working his
way right down to the mouth of the Mississippi, giving to the huge
tract of country which he had thus traversed the name of Louisiana,
after Louis XIV.
</p>

<p class="indent">
France thenceforth claimed the whole <i>hinterland</i>, as we should
now call it, of North America, the English being confined to the
comparatively narrow strip of country east of the Alleghanies. New
Orleans was founded at the mouth of the Mississippi in 1716, and
named after the Prince Regent; and French activity ranged between
Quebec and New Orleans, leaving many traces even to the present
day, in French names like Mobile, Detroit, and the like, through
the intervening country. The situation at the commencement of the
eighteenth century was remarkably similar to that of the Gold Coast
in Africa at the end of the nineteenth. The French persistently
attempted to encroach upon the English sphere of influence, and it
was in attempting to define the two spheres that George Washington
learned his first lesson in diplomacy and strategy. The French and
English American colonies were almost perpetually at war with one
another, the objective
<a name="page 152"><span class="page">Page 152</span></a>
being the spot where Pittsburg now stands, which was regarded as
the gate of the west, overlooking as it did the valley of the Ohio.
Here Duquesne founded the fort named after himself, and it was
not till 1758 that this was finally wrested from French hands;
while, in the following year, Wolfe, by his capture of Quebec,
overthrew the whole French power in North America. Throughout the
long fight the English had been much assisted by the guerilla warfare
of the Iroquois against the French.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By the Treaty of Paris in 1763 the whole of French America was
ceded to England, which also obtained possession of Florida from
Spain, in exchange for the Philippines, captured during the war.
As a compensation all the country west of the Mississippi became
joined on to the Spanish possessions in Mexico. These of course
became, nominally French when Napoleon's brother Joseph was placed
on the Spanish throne, but Napoleon sold them to the United States
in 1803, so that no barrier existed to the westward spread of the
States. Long previously to this, a Chartered Company had been formed
in 1670, with Prince Rupert at its head, to trade with the Indians
for furs in Hudson's Bay, then and for some time afterwards called
Rupertsland. The Hudson Bay Company gradually extended its knowledge
of the northerly parts of America towards the Rocky Mountains,
but it was not till 1740 that Varenne de la Varanderye discovered
their extent. In 1769-71 a fur trader named Hearne traced the river
Coppermine to the sea, while it was not till 1793 that Mr.
<a name="page 153"><span class="page">Page 153</span></a>
(after Sir A.) Mackenzie discovered the river now named after him,
and crossed the continent of North America from Atlantic to Pacific.
One of the reasons for this late exploration of the north-west of
North America was a geographical myth started by a Spanish voyager
named Juan de Fuca as early as 1592. Coasting as far as Vancouver
Island, he entered the inlet to the south of it, and not being
able to see land to the north, brought back a report of a huge sea
spreading over all that part of the country, which most geographers
assumed to pass over into Hudson Bay or the neighbourhood. It was
this report as much as anything which encouraged hopes of finding
the north-west passage in a latitude low enough to be free from
ice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As soon as the United States got possession of the land west of
the Mississippi they began to explore it, and between 1804 and
1807 Lewis and Clarke had explored the whole basin of the Missouri,
while Pike had investigated the country between the sources of the
Mississippi and the Red River. We have already seen that Behring
had carried over Russian investigation and dominion into Alaska,
and it was in order to avoid her encroachments down towards the
Californian coast that President Monroe put forth in 1823 the doctrine
that no further colonisation of the Americas would be permitted by
the United States. In this year Russia agreed to limit her claims
to the country north of 54.40&deg;. The States subsequently acquired
California and other adjoining states during
<a name="page 154"><span class="page">Page 154</span></a>
their war with Mexico in 1848, just before gold was discovered
in the Sacramento valley. The land between California and Alaska
was held in joint possession between Great Britain and the States,
and was known as the Oregon Territory. Lewis and Clarke had explored
the Columbia River, while Vancouver had much earlier examined the
island which now bears his name, so that both countries appear to
have some rights of discovery to the district. At one time the
inhabitants of the States were inclined to claim all the country
as far as the Russian boundary 54.40&deg;, and a war-cry arose
"54.40&deg; or fight;" but in 1846 the territory was divided by
the 49th parallel, and at this date we may say the partition of
America was complete, and all that remained to be known of it was
the ice-bound northern coast, over which so much heroic enterprise
has been displayed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The history of geographical discovery in America is thus in large
measure a history of conquest. Men got to know both coast-line and
interior while endeavouring either to trade or to settle where
nature was propitious, or the country afforded mineral or vegetable
wealth that could be easily transported. Of the coast early knowledge
was acquired for geography; but where the continent broadens out
either north or south, making the interior inaccessible for trade
purposes with the coasts, ignorance remained even down to the present
century. Even to the present day the country south of the valley
of the Amazon is perhaps as little known as any portion of the
earth's surface,
<a name="page 155"><span class="page">Page 155</span></a>
while, as we have seen, it was not till the early years of this
century that any knowledge was acquired of the huge tract of country
between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains. It was the natural
expansion of the United States, rendered possible by the cession
of this tract to the States by Napoleon in 1803, that brought it
within the knowledge of all. That expansion was chiefly due to the
improved methods of communication which steam has given to mankind
only within this century. But for this the region east of the Rocky
Mountains would possibly be as little known to Europeans, even at
the present day, as the Soudan or Somaliland. It is owing to this
natural expansion of the States, and in minor measure of Canada,
that few great names of geographical explorers are connected with
our knowledge of the interior of North America. Unknown settlers
have been the pioneers of geography, and not as elsewhere has the
reverse been the case. In the two other continents whose geographical
history we have still to trace, Australia and Africa, explorers
have preceded settlers or conquerors, and we can generally follow
the course of geographical discovery in their case without the
necessity of discussing their political history.

CHAPTER X
</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
AUSTRALIA AND THE SOUTH SEAS&mdash;TASMAN AND COOK
</p>

<p class="indent">
If one looks at the west coast of Australia one is struck by the
large number of Dutch names which are jotted down the coast. There
is Hoog Island, Diemen's Bay, Houtman's Abrolhos, De Wit land, and
the Archipelago of Nuyts, besides Dirk Hartog's Island and Cape
Leeuwin. To the extreme north we find the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and to the extreme south the island which used to be called Van
Diemen's Land. It is not altogether to be wondered at that almost
to the middle of this century the land we now call Australia was
tolerably well known as New Holland. If the Dutch had struck the
more fertile eastern shores of the Australian continent, it might
have been called with reason New Holland to the present day; but
there is scarcely any long coast-line of the world so inhospitable
and so little promising as that of Western Australia, and one can
easily understand how the Dutch, though they explored it, did not
care to take possession of it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But though the Dutch were the first to explore any considerable
stretch of Australian coast, they
<a name="page 157"><span class="page">Page 157</span></a>
were by no means the first to sight it. As early as 1542 a Spanish
expedition under Luis Lopez de Villalobos, was despatched to follow
up the discoveries of Magellan in the Pacific Ocean within the
Spanish sphere of influence. He discovered several of the islands
of Polynesia, and attempted to seize the Philippines, but his fleet
had to return to New Spain. One of the ships coasted along an island

</span>

to which was given the name of New Guinea, and was thought to be
part of the great unknown southern land which Ptolemy had imagined
to exist in the south of the Indian Ocean, and to be connected in
some way with Tierra del Fuego. Curiosity was thus aroused, and
in 1606 Pedro de Quiros was despatched on a voyage to the South
Seas with three
<a name="page 158"><span class="page">Page 158</span></a>
ships. He discovered the New Hebrides, and believed it formed part
of the southern continent, and he therefore named it Australia del
Espiritu Santo, and hastened home to obtain the viceroyalty of
this new possession. One of his ships got separated from him, and
the commander, Luys Vaz de Torres, sailed farther to the south-west,
and thereby learned that the New Australia was not a continent
but an island. He proceeded farther till he came to New Guinea,
which he coasted along the south coast, and seeing land to the
south of him, he thus passed through the straits since named after
him, and was probably the first European to see the continent of
Australia. In the very same year (1606) the Dutch yacht named the
<i>Duyfken</i> is said to have coasted along the south and west
coasts of New Guinea nearly a thousand miles, till they reached
Cape Keerweer, or "turn again." This was probably the north-west
coast of Australia. In the first thirty years of the seventeenth
century the Dutch followed the west coast of Australia with as
much industry as the Portuguese had done with the west coast of
Africa, leaving up to the present day signs of their explorations
in the names of islands, bays, and capes. Dirk Hartog, in the
<i>Endraaght</i>, discovered that Land which is named after his
ship, and the cape and roadstead named after himself, in 1616. Jan
Edels left his name upon the western coast in 1619; while, three
years later, a ship named the <i>Lioness</i> or <i>Leeuwin</i>
reached the most western point of the continent, to which its name
is still attached. Five years later, in 1627, De Nuyts coasted
<a name="page 159"><span class="page">Page 159</span></a>
round the south coast of Australia; while in the same year a Dutch
commander named Carpenter discovered and gave his name to the immense
indentation still known as the Gulf of Carpentaria.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But still more important discoveries were made in 1642 by an expedition
sent out from Batavia under ABEL JANSSEN TASMAN to investigate
the real extent of the southern land. After the voyages of the
<i>Leeuwin</i> and De Nuyts it was seen that the southern coast of
the new land trended to the east, instead of working round to the
west, as would have been the case if Ptolemy's views had been correct.
Tasman's problem was to discover whether it was connected with the
great southern land assumed to lie to the south of South America.
Tasman first sailed from Mauritius, and then directing his course
to the south-east, going much more south than Cape Leeuwin, at last
reached land in latitude 43.30&deg; and longitude 163.50&deg;. This
he called Van Diemen's Land, after the name of the Governor-General
of Batavia, and it was assumed that this joined on to the land
already discovered by De Nuyts. Sailing farther to the eastward,
Tasman came out into the open sea again, and thus appeared to prove
that the newly discovered land was not connected with the great
unknown continent round the south pole.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But he soon came across land which might possibly answer to that
description, and he called it Staaten Land, in honour of the
States-General of the Netherlands. This was undoubtedly some
<a name="page 160"><span class="page">Page 160</span></a>
part of New Zealand. Still steering eastward, but with a more northerly
trend, Tasman discovered several islands in the Pacific, and ultimately
reached Batavia after touching on New Guinea. His discoveries were
a great advance on previous knowledge; he had at any rate reduced
the possible dimensions of the unknown continent of the south within
narrow limits, and his discoveries were justly inscribed upon the map
of the world cut in stone upon the new Staathaus in Amsterdam, in
which the name New Holland was given by order of the States-General
to the western part of the "terra Australis." When England for a
time became joined on to Holland under the rule of William III.,
William Dampier was despatched to New Holland to make further
discoveries. He retraced the explorations of the Dutch from Dirk
Hartog's Bay to New Guinea, and appears to have been the first
European to have noticed the habits of the kangaroo; otherwise
his voyage did not add much to geographical knowledge, though when
he left the coasts of New Guinea he steered between New England
and New Ireland.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As a result of these Dutch voyages the existence of a great land
somewhere to the south-east of Asia became common property to all
civilised men. As an instance of this familiarity many years before
Cook's epoch-making voyages, it may be mentioned that in 1699 Captain
Lemuel Gulliver (in Swift's celebrated romance) arrived at the
kingdom of Lilliput by steering north-west from Van
<a name="page 161"><span class="page">Page 161</span></a>
Diemen's Land, which he mentions by name. Lilliput, it would thus
appear, was situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of the great
Bight of Australia. This curious mixture of definite knowledge
and vague ignorance on the part of Swift exactly corresponds to
the state of geographical knowledge about Australia in his days,
as is shown in the preceding map of those parts of the world, as
given by the great French cartographer D'Anville in 1745
(<a href="#page 157">p. 157</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
These discoveries of the Spanish and Dutch were direct results
and corollaries of the great search for the Spice Islands, which
has formed the main subject of our inquiries. The discoveries were
mostly made by ships fitted out in the Malay archipelago, if not
from the Spice Islands themselves. But at the beginning of the
eighteenth century new motives came into play in the search for
new lands; by that time almost the whole coast-line of the world
was roughly known. The Portuguese had coasted Africa, the Spanish
South America, the English most of the east of North America, while
Central America was known through the Spaniards. Many of the islands
of the Pacific Ocean had been touched upon, though not accurately
surveyed, and there remained only the north-west coast of America and
the north-east coast of Asia to be explored, while the great remaining
problem of geography was to discover if the great southern continent
assumed by Ptolemy existed, and, if so, what were its dimensions.
It happened that all these problems of coastline geography, if
we may so call it, were
<a name="page 162"><span class="page">Page 162</span></a>
destined to be solved by one man, an Englishman named JAMES COOK,
who, with Prince Henry, Magellan, and Tasman, may be said to have
determined the limits of the habitable land.
</p>

<p class="indent">
His voyages were made in the interests, not of trade or conquest,
but of scientific curiosity; and they were, appropriately enough,
begun in the interests of quite a different science than that of
geography. The English astronomer Halley had left as a sort of legacy
the task of examining the transit of Venus, which he predicted for
the year 1769, pointing out its paramount importance for determining
the distance of the sun from the earth. This transit could only
be observed in the southern hemisphere, and it was in order to
observe it that Cook made his first voyage of exploration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There was a double suitability in the motive of Cook's first voyage.
The work of his life could only have been carried out owing to the
improvement in nautical instruments which had been made during
the early part of the eighteenth century. Hadley had invented the
sextant, by which the sun's elevation could be taken with much
more ease and accuracy than with the old cross-staff, the very
rough gnomon which the earlier navigators had to use. Still more
important for scientific geography was the improvement that had
taken place in accurate chronometry. To find the latitude of a
place is not so difficult&mdash;the length of the day at different
times of the year will by itself be almost enough to determine
this, as we have seen in the very earliest history of Greek
<a name="page 163"><span class="page">Page 163</span></a>
geography&mdash;but to determine the longitude was a much more
difficult task, which in the earlier stages could only be formed
by guesswork and dead reckonings.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But when clocks had been brought to such a pitch of accuracy that
they would not lose but a few seconds or minutes during the whole
voyage, they could be used to determine the difference of local time
between any spot on the earth's surface and that of the port from
which the ship sailed, or from some fixed place where the clock could
be timed. The English government, seeing the importance of this,
proposed the very large reward of &pound;10,000 for the invention
of a chronometer which would not lose more than a stated number of
minutes during a year. This prize was won by John Harrison, and
from this time onward a sea-captain with a minimum of astronomical
knowledge was enabled to know his longitude within a few minutes.
Hadley's sextant and Harrison's chronometer were the necessary
implements to enable James Cook to do his work, which was thus,
both in aim and method, in every way English.
</p>

<p class="indent">
James Cook was a practical sailor, who had shown considerable
intelligence in sounding the St. Lawrence on Wolfe's expedition,
and had afterwards been appointed marine surveyor of Newfoundland.
When the Royal Society determined to send out an expedition to
observe the transit of Venus, according to Halley's prediction,
they were deterred from entrusting the expedition to a scientific man
<a name="page 164"><span class="page">Page 164</span></a>
by the example of Halley himself, who had failed to obtain obedience
from sailors on being entrusted with the command. Dalrymple, the
chief hydrographer of the Admiralty, who had chief claims to the
command, was also somewhat of a faddist, and Cook was selected
almost as a <i>dernier ressort</i>. The choice proved an excellent
one. He selected a coasting coaler named the <i>Endeavour</i>, of
360 tons, because her breadth of beam would enable her to carry
more stores and to run near coasts. Just before they started Captain
Wallis returned from a voyage round the world upon which he had
discovered or re-discovered Tahiti, and he recommended this as
a suitable place for observing the transit.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Cook duly arrived there, and on the 3rd of June 1769 the main object
of the expedition was fulfilled by a successful observation. But
he then proceeded farther, and arrived soon at a land which he
saw reason to identify with the Staaten Land of Tasman; but on
coasting along this, Cook found that, so far from belonging to a
great southern continent, it was composed of two islands, between
which he sailed, giving his name to the strait separating them.
Leaving New Zealand on the 31st of March 1770, on the 20th of the
next month he came across another land to the westward, hitherto
unknown to mariners. Entering an inlet, he explored the neighbourhood
with the aid of Mr. Joseph Banks, the naturalist of the expedition.
He found so many plants new to him, that the bay was termed Botany
Bay.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 165"><span class="page">Page 165</span></a>
He then coasted northward, and nearly lost his ship upon the great
reef running down the eastern coast; but by keeping within it he
managed to reach the extreme end of the land in this direction,
and proved that it was distinct from New Guinea. In other words,
he had reached the southern point of the strait named after Torres.
To this immense line of coast Cook gave the name of New South Wales,
from some resemblance that he saw to the coast about Swansea. By this
first voyage Cook had proved that neither New Holland nor Staaten
Land belonged to the great Antarctic continent, which remained
the sole myth bequeathed by the ancients which had not yet been
definitely removed from the maps. In his second voyage, starting
in 1772, he was directed to settle finally this problem. He went
at once to the Cape of Good Hope, and from there started out on
a zigzag journey round the Southern Pole, poking the nose of his
vessel in all directions as far south as he could reach, only pulling
up when he touched ice. In whatever direction he advanced he failed
to find any trace of extensive land corresponding to the supposed
Antarctic continent, which he thus definitely proved to be non-existent.
He spent the remainder of this voyage in rediscovering various
sets of archipelagos which preceding Spanish, Dutch, and English
navigators had touched, but had never accurately surveyed. Later
on Cook made a run across the Pacific from New Zealand to Cape
Horn without discovering any extensive land, thus
<a name="page 166"><span class="page">Page 166</span></a>
clinching the matter after three years' careful inquiry. It is
worthy of remark that during that long time he lost but four out
of 118 men, and only one of them by sickness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Only one great problem to maritime geography still remained to be
solved, that of the north-west passage, which, as we have seen,
had so frequently been tried by English navigators, working from
the east through Hudson's Bay. In 1776 Cook was deputed by George
III. to attempt the solution of this problem by a new method. He
was directed to endeavour to find an opening on the north-west
coast of America which would lead into Hudson's Bay. The old legend
of Juan de Fuca's great bay still misled geographers as to this
coast. Cook not alone settled this problem, but, by advancing through
Behring Strait and examining both sides of it, determined that
the two continents of Asia and America approached one another as
near as thirty-six miles. On his return voyage he landed at Owhyee
(Hawaii), where he was slain in 1777, and his ships returned to
England without adding anything further to geographical knowledge.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Cook's voyages had aroused the generous emulation of the French,
who, to their eternal honour, had given directions to their fleet
to respect his vessels wherever found, though France was at that
time at war with England. In 1783 an expedition was sent, under
Fran&ccedil;ois de la P&eacute;rouse, to complete Cook's work.
He explored the north-east coast of Asia, examined the island of
Saghalien, and passed through the
<a name="page 167"><span class="page">Page 167</span></a>
strait between it and Japan, often called by his name. In Kamtschatka
La P&eacute;rouse landed Monsieur Lesseps, who had accompanied the
expedition as Russian interpreter, and sent home by him his journals
and surveys. Lesseps made a careful examination of Kamtschatka
himself, and succeeded in passing overland thence to Paris, being
the first European to journey completely across the Old World from
the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. La P&eacute;rouse then proceeded
to follow Cook by examining the coast of New South Wales, and to
his surprise, when entering a fine harbour in the middle of the
coast, found there English ships engaged in settling the first
Australian colony in 1787. After again delivering his surveys to
be forwarded by the Englishmen, he started to survey the coast of
New Holland, but his expedition was never heard of afterwards.
As late as 1826 it was discovered that they had been wrecked on
Vanikoro, an island near the Fijis.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have seen that Cook's exploration of the eastern coast of Australia
was soon followed up by a settlement. A number of convicts were
sent out under Captain Philips to Botany Bay, and from that time
onward English explorers gradually determined with accuracy both
the coast-line and the interior of the huge stretch of land known
to us as Australia. One of the ships that had accompanied Cook on
his second voyage had made a rough survey of Van Diemen's Land, and
had come to the conclusion that it joined on to the mainland. But
in 1797, Bass, a surgeon in the navy, coasted down from Port Jackson
<a name="page 168"><span class="page">Page 168</span></a>
to the south in a fine whale boat with a crew of six men, and discovered
open sea running between the southernmost point and Van Diemen's
Land; this is still known as Bass' Strait. A companion of his,
named Flinders, coasted, in 1799, along the south coast from Cape
Leeuwin eastward, and on this voyage met a French ship at Encounter
Bay, so named from the <i>rencontre</i>. Proceeding farther, he
discovered Port Philip; and the coast-line of Australia was
approximately settled after Captain P. P. King in four voyages,
between 1817 and 1822, had investigated the river mouths.

<p class="indent">
The interior now remained to be investigated. On the east coast
this was rendered difficult by the range of the Blue Mountains,
honeycombed throughout with huge gullies, which led investigators
time after time into a cul-de-sac; but in 1813 Philip Wentworth
managed to cross them, and found a fertile plateau to the westward.
Next year Evans discovered the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers, and
penetrated farther into the Bathurst plains. In 1828-29 Captain
Sturt increased the knowledge of the interior by tracing the course
of the two great rivers Darling and Murray. In 1848 the German
explorer Leichhardt lost his life in an attempt to penetrate the
interior northward; but in 1860 two explorers, named Burke and Wills,
managed to pass from south to north along the east coast; while, in
the four years 1858 to 1862, John M'Dowall Stuart performed the
still more difficult feat of crossing the centre of the continent
from south to north, in order to trace a course
<a name="page 170"><span class="page">Page 170</span></a>
for the telegraphic line which was shortly afterwards erected.
By this time settlements had sprung up throughout the whole coast
of Eastern Australia, and there only remained the western desert
to be explored. This was effected in two journeys of John Forrest,
between 1868 and 1874, who penetrated from Western Australia as
far as the central telegraphic line; while, between 1872 and 1876,
Ernest Giles performed the same feat to the north. Quite recently, in
1897, these two routes were joined by the journey of the Honourable
Daniel Carnegie from the Coolgardie gold fields in the south to
those of Kimberley in the north. These explorations, while adding
to our knowledge of the interior of Australia, have only confirmed
the impression that it was not worth knowing.

<p class="subtitle">
EXPLORATION AND PARTITION OF AFRICA:
PARK&mdash;LIVINGSTONE&mdash;STANLEY
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have seen how the Portuguese had slowly coasted along the shore
of Africa during the fifteeenth century in search of a way to the
Indies. By the end of the century mariners <i>portulanos</i> gave
a rude yet effective account of the littoral of Africa, both on the
west and the eastern side. Not alone did they explore the coast, but
they settled upon it. At Amina on the Guinea coast, at Loando near
the Congo, and at Benguela on the western coast, they established
stations whence to despatch the gold and ivory, and, above all, the
slaves, which turned out to be the chief African products of use
to Europeans. On the east coast they settled at Sofala, a port of
Mozambique; and in Zanzibar they possessed no less than three ports,
those first visited by Vasco da Gama and afterwards celebrated by
Milton in the sonorous line contained in the gorgeous geographical
excursus in the Eleventh Book&mdash;

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 172"><span class="page">Page 172</span></a>
It is probable that, besides settling on the coast, the Portuguese
from time to time made explorations into the interior. At any rate,
in some maps of the sixteenth and seventeenth century there is
shown a remarkable knowledge of the course of the Nile. We get
it terminated in three large lakes, which can be scarcely other
than the Victoria and Albert Nyanza, and Tanganyika. The Mountains
of the Moon also figure prominently, and it was only almost the
other day that Mr. Stanley re-discovered them. It is difficult,
however, to determine how far these entries on the Portuguese maps
were due to actual knowledge or report, or to the traditions of a
still earlier knowledge of these lakes and mountains; for in the
maps accompanying the early editions of Ptolemy we likewise obtain
the same information, which is repeated by the Arabic geographers,
obviously from Ptolemy, and not from actual observation. When the
two great French cartographers Delisle and D'Anville determined
not to insert anything on their maps for which they had not some
evidence, these lakes and mountains disappeared, and thus it has
come about that maps of the seventeenth century often appear to
display more knowledge of the interior of Africa than those of the
beginning of the nineteenth, at least with regard to the sources
of the Nile.
</p>

<p class="indent">
African exploration of the interior begins with the search for
the sources of the Nile, and has been mainly concluded by the
determination of the course of the three other great rivers, the
Niger, the Zambesi, and the Congo. It is
<a name="page 173"><span class="page">Page 173</span></a>
remarkable that all four rivers have had their course determined
by persons of British nationality. The names of Bruce and Grant
will always be associated with the Nile, that of Mungo Park with
the Niger, Dr. Livingstone with the Zambesi, and Mr. Stanley with

the Congo. It is not inappropriate that, except in the case of
the Congo, England should control the course of the rivers which
her sons first made accessible to civilisation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 174"><span class="page">Page 174</span></a>
We have seen that there was an ancient tradition reported by Herodotus,
that the Nile trended off to the west and became there the river
Niger; while still earlier there was an impression that part of
it at any rate wandered eastward, and some way joined on to the
same source as the Tigris and Euphrates&mdash;at least that seems
to be the suggestion in the biblical account of Paradise. Whatever
the reason, the greatest uncertainty existed as to the actual course
of the river, and to discover the source of the Nile was for many
centuries the standing expression for performing the impossible. In
1768, James Bruce, a Scottish gentleman of position, set out with
the determination of solving this mystery&mdash;a determination
which he had made in early youth, and carried out with characteristic
pertinacity. He had acquired a certain amount of knowledge of Arabic
and acquaintance with African customs as Consul at Algiers. He went
up the Nile as far as Farsunt, and then crossed the desert to the Red
Sea, went over to Jedda, from which he took ship for Massowah, and
began his search for the sources of the Nile in Abyssinia. He visited
the ruins of Axum, the former capital, and in the neighbourhood of
that place saw the incident with which his travels have always
been associated, in which a couple of rump-steaks were extracted
from a cow while alive, the wound sewn up, and the animal driven
on farther.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Here, guided by some Gallas, he worked his way up the Blue Nile to
the three fountains, which he declared to be the true sources of the
<a name="page 175"><span class="page">Page 175</span></a>
Nile, and identified with the three mysterious lakes in the old
maps. From there he worked his way down the Nile, reaching Cairo
in 1773. Of course what he had discovered was merely the source
of the Blue Nile, and even this had been previously visited by a
Portuguese traveller named Payz. But the interesting adventures
which he experienced, and the interesting style in which he told
them, aroused universal attention, which was perhaps increased
by the fact that his journey was undertaken purely from love of
adventure and discovery. The year 1768 is distinguished by the
two journeys of James Cook and James Bruce, both of them expressly
for purposes of geographical discovery, and thus inaugurating the
era of what may be called scientific exploration. Ten years later
an association was formed named the African Association, expressly
intended to explore the unknown parts of Africa, and the first
geographical society called into existence. In 1795 MUNGO PARK was
despatched by the Association to the west coast. He started from
the Gambia, and after many adventures, in which he was captured
by the Moors, arrived at the banks of the Niger, which he traced
along its middle course, but failed to reach as far as Timbuctoo.
He made a second attempt in 1805, hoping by sailing down the Niger
to prove its identity with the river known at its mouth as the
Congo; but he was forced to return, and died at Boussa, without
having determined the remaining course of the Niger.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Attention was thus drawn to the existence
<a name="page 176"><span class="page">Page 176</span></a>
of the mysterious city of Timbuctoo, of which Mungo Park had brought
back curious rumours on his return from his first journey. This
was visited in 1811 by a British seaman named Adams, who had been
wrecked on the Moorish coast, and taken as a slave by the Moors
across to Timbuctoo. He was ultimately ransomed by the British
consul at Mogador, and his account revived interest in West African
exploration. Attempts were made to penetrate the secret of the Niger,
both from Senegambia and from the Congo, but both were failures,
and a fresh method was adopted, possibly owing to Adams' experience
in the attempt to reach the Niger by the caravan routes across the
Sahara. In 1822 Major Denham and Lieutenant Clapperton left Murzouk,
the capital of Fezzan, and made their way to Lake Chad and thence to
Bornu. Clapperton, later on, again visited the Niger from Benin.
Altogether these two travellers added some two thousand miles of
route to our knowledge of, West Africa. In 1826-27 Timbuctoo was at
last visited by two Europeans&mdash;Major Laing in the former year,
who was murdered there; and a young Frenchman, R&eacute;n&eacute;
Cailli&eacute;, in the latter. His account aroused great interest,
and Tennyson began his poetic career by a prize-poem on the subject
of the mysterious African capital.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It was not till 1850 that the work of Denham and Clapperton was
again taken up by Barth, who for five years explored the whole
country to the west of Lake Chad, visiting Timbuctoo, and connecting
the lines of route of Clapperton
<a name="page 177"><span class="page">Page 177</span></a>
and Cailli&eacute;. What he did for the west of Lake Chad was
accomplished by Nachtigall east of that lake in Darfur and Wadai, in
a journey which likewise took five years (1869-74). Of recent years
political interests have caused numerous expeditions, especially by
the French to connect their possessions in Algeria and Tunis with
those on the Gold Coast and on the Senegal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next stage in African exploration is connected with the name
of the man to whom can be traced practically the whole of recent
discoveries. By his tact in dealing with the natives, by his calm
pertinacity and dauntless courage, DAVID LIVINGSTONE succeeded
in opening up the entirely unknown districts of Central Africa.
Starting from the Cape in 1849, he worked his way northward to the
Zambesi, and then to Lake Dilolo, and after five years' wandering
reached the western coast of Africa at Loanda. Then retracing his
steps to the Zambesi again, he followed its course to its mouth
on the east coast, thus for the first time crossing Africa from
west to east. In a second journey, on which he started in 1858,
he commenced tracing the course of the river Shir&eacute;, the
most important affluent of the Zambesi, and in so doing arrived
on the shores of Lake Nyassa in September 1859.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile two explorers, Captain (afterwards Sir Richard) Burton
and Captain Speke, had started from Zanzibar to discover a lake of
which rumours had for a long time been heard, and in the following
year succeeded in reaching
<a name="page 178"><span class="page">Page 178</span></a>
Lake Tanganyika. On their return Speke parted from Burton and took
a route more to the north, from which he saw another great lake,
which afterwards turned out to be the Victoria Nyanza. In 1860, with
another companion (Captain Grant), Speke returned to the Victoria
Nyanza, and traced out its course. On the north of it they found
a great river trending to the north, which they followed as far
as Gondokoro. Here they found Mr. (afterwards Sir Samuel) Baker,
who had travelled up the White Nile to investigate its source,
which they thus proved to be in the Lake Victoria Nyanza. Baker
continued his search, and succeeded in showing that another source
of the Nile was to be found in a smaller lake to the west, which
he named Albert Nyanza. Thus these three Englishmen had combined
to solve the long-sought problem of the sources of the Nile.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The discoveries of the Englishmen were soon followed up by important
political action by the Khedive of Egypt, Ismail Pasha, who claimed
the whole course of the Nile as part of his dominions, and established
stations all along it. This, of course, led to full information about
the basin of the Nile being acquired for geographical purposes, and,
under Sir Samuel Baker and Colonel Gordon, civilisation was for a
time in possession of the Nile from its source to its mouth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile Livingstone had set himself to solve the problem of the
great Lake Tanganyika, and started on his last journey in 1865
for that purpose. He discovered Lakes Moero
<a name="page 179"><span class="page">Page 179</span></a>
and Bangweolo, and the river Nyangoue, also known as Lualaba. So
much interest had been aroused by Livingstone's previous exploits
of discovery, that when nothing had been heard of him for some
time, in 1869 Mr. H. M. Stanley was sent by the proprietors of
the <i>New York Herald</i>, for whom he had previously acted as
war-correspondent, to find Livingstone. He started in 1871 from
Zanzibar, and before the end of the year had come across a white man
in the heart of the Dark Continent, and greeted him with the historic
query, "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" Two years later Livingstone
died, a martyr to geographical and missionary enthusiasm. His work
was taken up by Mr. Stanley, who in 1876 was again despatched to
continue Livingstone's work, and succeeded in crossing the Dark
Continent from Zanzibar to the mouth of the Congo, the whole course
of which he traced, proving that the Lualaba or Nyangoue were merely
different names or affluents of this mighty stream. Stanley's remarkable
journey completed the rough outline of African geography by defining
the course of the fourth great river of the continent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But Stanley's journey across the Dark Continent was destined to be
the starting-point of an entirely new development of the African
problem. Even while Stanley was on his journey a conference had been
assembled at Brussels by King Leopold, in which an international
committee was formed representing all the nations of Europe, nominally
for the exploration of Africa, but, as it turned out, really for
its partition
<a name="page 180"><span class="page">Page 180</span></a>
among the European powers. Within fifteen years of the assembly
of the conference the interior of Africa had been parcelled out,
mainly among the five powers, England, France, Germany, Portugal,
and Belgium. As in the case of America, geographical discovery
was soon followed by political division.

EXPLORATION AND PARTITION OF AFRICA.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
The process began by the carving out of a state covering the whole
of the newly-discovered Congo, nominally independent, but really
forming a colony of Belgium, King Leopold supplying the funds for
that purpose. Mr. Stanley was despatched in 1879 to establish stations
along the lower course of the river, but, to his surprise, he found
that he had been anticipated by M. de Brazza, a Portuguese in the
service of France, who had been despatched on a secret mission to
anticipate the King of the Belgians in seizing the important river
mouth. At the same time Portugal put in claims for possession of
the Congo mouth, and it became clear that international rivalries
would interfere with the foundation of any state on the Congo unless
some definite international arrangement was arrived at. Almost
about the same time, in 1880, Germany began to enter the field
as a colonising power in Africa. In South-West Africa and in the
Cameroons, and somewhat later in Zanzibar, claims were set up on
behalf of Germany by Prince Bismarck which conflicted with English
interests in those districts, and under his presidency a Congress
was held at Berlin in the winter of 1884-85 to determine the rules
of the claims by which Africa could be partitioned.
<a name="page 182"><span class="page">Page 182</span></a>
The old historic claims of Portugal to the coast of Africa, on
which she had established stations both on the west and eastern
side, were swept away by the principle that only effective occupation
could furnish a claim of sovereignty. This great principle will rule
henceforth the whole course of African history; in other words,
the good old Border rule&mdash;
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"That they should take who have the power.<br>
&nbsp;And they should keep who can."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Almost immediately after the sitting of the Berlin Congress, and
indeed during it, arrangements were come to by which the respective
claims of England and Germany in South-West Africa were definitely
determined. Almost immediately afterwards a similar process had to
be gone through in order to determine the limits of the respective
"spheres of influence," as they began to be called, of Germany and
England in East Africa. A Chartered Company, called the British East
Africa Association, was to administer the land north of Victoria Nyanza
bounded on the west by the Congo Free State, while to the north it
extended till it touched the revolted provinces of Egypt, of which
we shall soon speak. In South Africa a similar Chartered Company,
under the influence of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, practically controlled the
whole country from Cape Colony up to German East Africa and the
Congo Free State.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The winter of 1890-91 was especially productive of agreements of
demarcation. After a considerable amount of friction owing to
<a name="page 183"><span class="page">Page 183</span></a>
the encroachments of Major Serpa Pinto, the limits of Portuguese
Angola on the west coast were then determined, being bounded on
the east by the Congo Free State and British Central Africa; and
at the same time Portuguese East Africa was settled in its relation
both to British Central Africa on the west and German East Africa
on the north. Meanwhile Italy had put in its claims for a share in
the spoil, and the eastern horn of Africa, together with Abyssinia,
fell to its share, though it soon had to drop it, owing to the
unexpected vitality shown by the Abyssinians. In the same year
(1890) agreements between Germany and England settled the line of
demarcation between the Cameroons and Togoland, with the adjoining
British territories; while in August of the same year an attempt
was made to limit the abnormal pretensions of the French along
the Niger, and as far as Lake Chad. Here the British interests
were represented by another Chartered Company, the Royal Niger
Company. Unfortunately the delimitation was not very definite,
not being by river courses or meridians as in other cases, but
merely by territories ruled over by native chiefs, whose boundaries
were not then particularly distinct. This has led to considerable
friction, lasting even up to the present day; and it is only with
reference to the demarcation between England and France in Africa
that any doubt still remains with regard to the western and central
portions of the continent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Towards the north-east the problem of delimitation had been complicated
by political
<a name="page 184"><span class="page">Page 184</span></a>
events, which ultimately led to another great exploring expedition
by Mr. Stanley. The extension of Egypt into the Equatorial Provinces
under Ismail Pasha, due in large measure to the geographical discoveries
of Grant, Speke, and Baker, led to an enormous accumulation of
debt, which caused the country to become bankrupt, Ismail Pasha
to be deposed, and Egypt to be administered jointly by France and
England on behalf of the European bondholders. This caused much
dissatisfaction on the part of the Egyptian officials and army
officers, who were displaced by French and English officials; and
a rebellion broke out under Arabi Pasha. This led to the armed
intervention of England, France having refused to co-operate, and
Egypt was occupied by British troops. The Soudan and Equatorial
Provinces had independently revolted under Mohammedan fanaticism,
and it was determined to relinquish those Egyptian possessions,
which had originally led to bankruptcy. General Gordon was despatched
to relieve the various Egyptian garrisons in the south, but being
without support, ultimately failed, and was killed in 1885. One
of Gordon's lieutenants, a German named Schnitzler, who appears
to have adopted Mohammedanism, and was known as Emin Pasha, was
thus isolated in the midst of Africa near the Albert Nyanza, and
Mr. Stanley was commissioned to attempt his rescue in 1887. He
started to march through the Congo State, and succeeded in traversing
a huge tract of forest country inhabited by diminutive savages,
who probably represented
<a name="page 185"><span class="page">Page 185</span></a>
the Pigmies of the ancients. He succeeded in reaching Emin Pasha,
and after much persuasion induced him to accompany him to Zanzibar,
only, however, to return as a German agent to the Albert Nyanza. Mr.
Stanley's journey on this occasion was not without its political
aspects, since he made arrangements during the eastern part of his
journey for securing British influence for the lands afterwards
handed over to the British East Africa Company.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All these political delimitations were naturally accompanied by
explorations, partly scientific, but mainly political. Major Serpa
Pinto twice crossed Africa in an attempt to connect the Portuguese
settlements on the two coasts. Similarly, Lieutenant Wissmann also
crossed Africa twice, between 1881 and 1887, in the interests of
the Congo State, though he ultimately became an official of his
native country, Germany. Captain Lugard had investigated the region
between the three Lakes Nyanza, and secured it for Great Britain.
In South Africa British claims were successfully and successively
advanced to Bechuana-land, Mashona-land, and Matabele-land, and,
under the leadership of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, a railway and telegraph
were rapidly pushed forward towards the north. Owing to the enterprise
of Mr. (now Sir H. H.) Johnstone, the British possessions were in
1891 pushed up as far as Nyassa-land. By that date, as we have
seen, various treaties with Germany and Portugal had definitely
fixed the contour lines of the different possessions of the three
countries in South Africa. By 1891 the interior
<a name="page 186"><span class="page">Page 186</span></a>
of Africa, which had up to 1880 been practically a blank, could
be mapped out almost with as much accuracy as, at any rate, South
America. Europe had taken possession of Africa.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One of the chief results of this, and formally one of its main
motives, was the abolition of the slave trade. North Africa has
been Mohammedan since the eighth century, and Islam has always
recognised slavery, consequently the Arabs of the north have continued
to make raids upon the negroes of Central Africa, to supply the
Mohammedan countries of West Asia and North Africa with slaves.
The Mahdist rebellion was in part at least a reaction against the
abolition of slavery by Egypt, and the interest of the next few
years will consist in the last stand of the slave merchants in
the Soudan, in Darfur, and in Wadai, east of Lake Chad, where the
only powerful independent Mohammedan Sultanate still exists. England
is closely pressing upon the revolted provinces, along the upper
course of the Nile; while France is attempting, by expeditions
from the French Congo and through Abyssinia, to take possession
of the Upper Nile before England conquers it. The race for the
Upper Nile is at present one of the sources of danger of European

While exploration and conquest have either gone hand in hand, or
succeeded one another very closely, there has been a third motive
that has often led to interesting discoveries, to be followed by
annexation. The mighty hunters of Africa have often brought back,
not alone
<a name="page 187"><span class="page">Page 187</span></a>
ivory and skins, but also interesting information of the interior.
The gorgeous narratives of Gordon Cumming in the "fifties" were
one of the causes which led to an interest in African exploration.
Many a lad has had his imagination fired and his career determined
by the exploits of Gordon Cumming, which are now, however, almost
forgotten. Mr. F. C. Selous has in our time surpassed even Gordon
Cumming's exploits, and has besides done excellent work as guide
for the successive expeditions into South Africa.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus, practically within our own time, the interior of Africa, where
once geographers, as the poet Butler puts it, "placed elephants instead
of towns," has become known, in its main outlines, by successive
series of intrepid explorers, who have often had to be warriors as
well as scientific men. Whatever the motives that have led the white
man into the centre of the Dark Continent&mdash;love of adventure,
scientific curiosity, big game, or patriotism&mdash;the result
has been that the continent has become known instead of merely
its coast-line. On the whole, English exploration has been the
main means by which our knowledge of the interior of Africa has
been obtained, and England has been richly rewarded by coming into
possession of the most promising parts of the continent&mdash;the
Nile valley and temperate South Africa. But France has also gained
a huge extent of country covering almost the whole of North-West
Africa. While much of this is merely desert, there are caravan
routes which
<a name="page 188"><span class="page">Page 188</span></a>
tap the basin of the Niger and conduct its products to Algeria,
conquered by France early in the century, and to Tunis, more recently
appropriated. The West African provinces of France have, at any
rate, this advantage, that they are nearer to the mother-country
than any other colony of a European power; and the result may be
that African soldiers may one of these days fight for France on
European soil, just as the Indian soldiers were imported to Cyprus
by Lord Beaconsfield in 1876. Meanwhile, the result of all this
international ambition has been that Africa in its entirety is
now known and accessible to European civilisation.

<p class="subtitle">
THE POLES&mdash;FRANKLIN&mdash;ROSS&mdash;NORDENSKIOLD&mdash;NANSEN
</p>

<p class="indent">
Almost the whole of the explorations which we have hitherto described
or referred to had for their motive some practical purpose, whether
to reach the Spice Islands or to hunt big game. Even the excursions
of Davis, Frobisher, Hudson, and Baffin in pursuit of the north-west
passage, and of Barentz and Chancellor in search of the north-east
passage, were really in pursuit of mercantile ends. It is only with
James Cook that the era of purely scientific exploration begins,
though it is fair to qualify this statement by observing that the
Russian expedition under Behring, already referred to, was ordered
by Peter the Great to determine a strictly geographical problem,
though doubtless it had its bearings on Russian ambitions. Behring
and Cook between them, as we have seen, settled the problem of the
relations existing between the ends of the two continents Asia and
America, but what remained still to the north of <i>terra firma</i>
within the Arctic Circle? That was the problem which the nineteenth
century set itself to solve, and has very nearly succeeded in the
solution. For
<a name="page 190"><span class="page">Page 190</span></a>
the Arctic Circle we now possess maps that only show blanks over
a few thousand square miles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This knowledge has been gained by slow degrees, and by the exercise
of the most heroic courage and endurance. It is a heroic tate, in
which love of adventure and zeal for science have combated with
and conquered the horrors of an Arctic winter, the six months'
darkness in silence and desolation, the excessive cold, and the
dangers of starvation. It is impossible here to go into any of
the details which rendered the tale of Arctic voyages one of the
most stirring in human history. All we are concerned with here is
the amount of new knowledge brought back by successive expeditions
within the Arctic Circle.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This region of the earth's surface is distinguished by a number
of large islands in the eastern hemisphere, most of which were
discovered at an early date. We have seen how the Norsemen landed
and settled upon Greenland as early as the tenth century. Burrough
sighted Nova Zembla in 1556; in one of the voyages in search of the
north-east passage, though the very name (Russian for Newfoundland)
implies that it had previously been sighted and named by Russian
seamen. Barentz is credited with having sighted Spitzbergen. The
numerous islands to the north of Siberia became known through the
Russian investigations of Discheneff, Behring, and their followers;
while the intricate network of islands to the north of the continent
of North America had been slowly worked out during the search for
the north-west passage.
<a name="page 191"><span class="page">Page 191</span></a>
It was indeed in pursuit of this will-of-the-wisp that most of the
discoveries in the Arctic Circle were made, and a general impetus
given to Arctic exploration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is with a renewed attempt after this search that the modern
history of Arctic exploration begins. In 1818 two expeditions were
sent under the influence of Sir Joseph Banks to search the north-west
passage, and to attempt to reach the Pole. The former was the objective
of John Ross in the <i>Isabella</i> and W. E. Parry in the
<i>Alexander</i>, while in the Polar exploration John Franklin
sailed in the <i>Trent</i>. Both expeditions were unsuccessful,
though Ross and Parry confirmed Baffin's discoveries. Notwithstanding
this, two expeditions were sent two years later to attempt the
north-west passage, one by land under Franklin, and the other by
sea under Parry. Parry managed to get half-way across the top of
North America, discovered the archipelago named after him, and
reached 114&deg; West longitude, thereby gaining the prize of
&pound;5000 given by the British Parliament for the first seaman
that sailed west of the 110th meridian. He was brought up, however,
by Banks Land, while the strait which, if he had known it, would
have enabled him to complete the north-west passage, was at that
time closed by ice. In two successive voyages, in 1822 and 1824,
Parry increased the detailed knowledge of the coasts he had already
discovered, but failed to reach even as far westward as he had done
on his first voyage. This somewhat discouraged Government attempts
at exploration,
<a name="page 192"><span class="page">Page 192</span></a>
and the next expedition, in 1829, was fitted out by Mr. Felix Booth,
sheriff of London, who despatched the paddle steamer <i>Victory</i>,
commanded by John Ross. He discovered the land known as Boothia
Felix, and his nephew, James C. Ross, proved that it belonged to
the mainland of America, which he coasted along by land to Cape
Franklin, besides determining the exact position of the North Magnetic
Pole at Cape Adelaide, on Boothia Felix. After passing five years
within the Arctic Circle, Ross and his companions, who had been
compelled to abandon the <i>Victory</i>, fell in with a whaler,
which brought them home.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We must now revert to Franklin, who, as we have seen, had been
despatched by the Admiralty to outline the north coast of America,
only two points of which had been determined, the embouchures of
the Coppermine and the Mackenzie, discovered respectively by Hearne
and Mackenzie. It was not till 1821 that Franklin was able to start
out from the mouth of the Coppermine eastward in two canoes, by
which he coasted along till he came to the point named by him Point
Turn-again. By that time only three days' stores of pemmican remained,
and it was only with the greatest difficulty, and by subsisting
on lichens and scraps of roasted leather, that they managed to
return to their base of operations at Fort Enterprise. Four years
later, in 1825, Franklin set out on another exploring expedition
with the same object, starting this time from the mouth of the
Mackenzie river, and despatching one of his companions,
<a name="page 193"><span class="page">Page 193</span></a>
Richardson, to connect the coast between the Mackenzie and the
Coppermine; while he himself proceeded westward to meet the Blossom,
which, under Captain Beechey, had been despatched to Behring Strait
to bring his party back. Richardson was entirely successful in
examining the coast-line between the Mackenzie and the Coppermine;
but Beechey, though he succeeded in rounding Icy Cape and tracing
the coast as far as Point Barrow, did not come up to Franklin, who
had only got within 160 miles at Return Reef. These 160 miles, as
well as the 222 miles intervening between Cape Turn-again, Franklin's
easternmost point by land, and Cape Franklin, J. C. Ross's most
westerly point, were afterwards filled in by T. Simpson in 1837,
after a coasting voyage in boats of 1408 miles, which stands as a
record even to this day. Meanwhile the Great Fish River had been
discovered and followed to its mouth by C. J. Back in 1833. During
the voyage down the river, an oar broke while the boat was shooting
a rapid, and one of the party commenced praying in a loud voice;
whereupon the leader called out: "Is this a time for praying? Pull
your starboard oar!"
</p>

<p class="indent">
Meanwhile, interest had been excited rather more towards the South
Pole, and the land of which Cook had found traces in his search
for the fabled Australian continent surrounding it. He had reached
as far south as 71.10&deg;, when he was brought up by the great
ice barrier. In 1820-23 Weddell visited the South Shetlands, south
of Cape Horn, and found an active
<a name="page 194"><span class="page">Page 194</span></a>
volcano, even amidst the extreme cold of that district. He reached
as far south as 74&deg;, but failed to come across land in that
district. In 1839 Bellany discovered the islands named after him,
with a volcano twelve thousand feet high, and another still active
on Buckle Island. In 1839 a French expedition under Dumont d'Urville
again visited and explored the South Shetlands; while, in the following
year, Captain Wilkes, of the United States navy, discovered the
land named after him. But the most remarkable discovery made in
Antarctica was that of Sir J. C. Ross, who had been sent by the
Admiralty in 1840 to identify the South Magnetic Pole, as we have
seen he had discovered that of the north. With the two ships
<i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> he discovered Victoria Land and
the two active volcanoes named after his ships, and pouring forth
flaming lava, amidst the snow. In January 1842 he reached farthest
south, 76&deg;. Since his time little has been attempted in the
south, though in the winter of 1894-95 C. E. Borchgrevink again
visited Victoria Land.

NORTH POLAR REGION&mdash;WESTERN HALF.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
On the return of the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> from the South
Seas the government placed these two vessels at the disposal of
Franklin (who had been knighted for his previous discoveries), and
on the 26th of May 1845 he started with one hundred and twenty-nine
souls on board the two vessels, which were provisioned up to July
1848. They were last seen by a whaler on the 26th July of the former
year waiting to pass into Lancaster Sound. After penetrating as
<a name="page 196"><span class="page">Page 196</span></a>
far north as 77&deg;, through Wellington Channel, Franklin was
obliged to winter upon Beechey Island, and in the following year
(September 1846) his two ships were beset in Victoria Strait, about
twelve miles from King William Land. Curiously enough, in the following
year (1847) J. Rae had been despatched by land from Cape Repulse
in Hudson's Bay, and had coasted along the east coast of Boothia,
thus connecting Ross's and Franklin's coast journeys with Hudson's
Bay. On 18th April 1847 Rae had reached a point on Boothia less
than 150 miles from Franklin on the other side of it. Less than two
months later, on the 11th June, Franklin died on the <i>Erebus</i>.
His ships were only provisioned to July 1848, and remained still
beset throughout the whole of 1847. Crozier, upon whom the command
devolved, left the ship with one hundred and five survivors to
try and reach Back's Fish River. They struggled along the west
coast of King William Land, but failed to reach their destination;
disease, and even starvation, gradually lessened their numbers.
An old Eskimo woman, who had watched the melancholy procession,
afterwards told M'Clintock they fell down and died as they walked.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By this time considerable anxiety had been roused by the absence of
any news from Franklin's party. Richardson and Rae were despatched
by land in 1848, while two ships were sent on the attempt to reach
Franklin through Behring Strait, and two others, the <i>Investigator</i>
and the <i>Enterprise</i>, under J. C. Ross, through Baffin Bay.
Rae reached the east coast of Victoria
<a name="page 197"><span class="page">Page 197</span></a>
Land, and arrived within fifty miles of the spot where Franklin's two
ships had been abandoned; but it was not till his second expedition
by land, which started in 1853, that he obtained any news. After
wintering at Lady Pelly Bay, on the 20th April 1854 Rae met a young
Eskimo, who told him that four years previously forty white men
had been seen dragging a boat to the south on the west shore of
King William Land, and a few months later the bodies of thirty
of these men had been found by the Eskimo, who produced silver
with the Franklin crest to confirm the truth of their statement.
Further searches by land were continued up to as late as 1879,
when Lieutenant F. Schwatka, of the United States army, discovered
several of the graves and skeletons of the Franklin expedition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Neither of the two attempts by sea from the Atlantic or from the
Pacific base, in 1848, having succeeded in gaining any news, the
<i>Enterprise</i> and the <i>Investigator</i>, which had previously
attempted to reach Franklin from the east, were despatched in 1850,
under Captain R. Collinson and Captain M'Clure; to attempt the
search from the west through Behring Strait. M'Clure, in the
<i>Investigator</i>, did not wait for Collinson, as he had been
directed, but pushed on and discovered Banks Land, and became beset
in the ice in Prince of Wales Strait. In the winter of 1850-51 he
endeavoured unsuccessfully to work his way from this strait into
Parry Sound, but in August and September 1851 managed to coast
round Banks Land to its most north-westerly
<a name="page 198"><span class="page">Page 198</span></a>
point, and then succeeded in passing through the strait named after
M'Clure, and reached Barrow Strait, thus performing for the first
time the north-west passage, though it was not till 1853 that the
<i>Investigator</i> was abandoned. Collinson, in the <i>Enterprise</i>,
followed M'Clure closely, though never reaching him, and attempting
to round Prince Albert Land by the south through Dolphin Strait,
reached Cambridge Bay at the nearest point by ship of all the Franklin
expeditions. He had to return westward, and only reached England
in 1855, after an absence of five years and four months.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From the east no less than ten vessels had attempted the Franklin
sea search in 1851, comprising two Admiralty expeditions, one private
English one, an American combined government and private party,
together with a ship put in commission by the wifely devotion of
Lady Franklin. These all attempted the search of Lancaster Sound,
where Franklin had last been seen, and they only succeeded in finding
three graves of men who had died at an early stage, and had been
buried on Beechey Island. Another set of four vessels were despatched
under Sir Edward Belcher in 1852, who were fortunate enough to
reach M'Clure in the <i>Investigator</i> in the following year,
and enabled him to complete the north-west passage, for which he
gained the reward of &pound;10,000 offered by Parliament in 1763. But
Belcher was obliged to abandon most of his vessels, one of which,
the <i>Resolute</i>, drifted over a thousand miles, and having been
<a name="page 199"><span class="page">Page 199</span></a>
recovered by an American whaler, was refitted by the United States
and presented to the queen and people of Great Britain.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Notwithstanding all these efforts, the Franklin remains have not
yet been discovered, though Dr. Rae, as we have seen, had practically
ascertained their terrible fate. Lady Franklin, however, was not
satisfied with this vague information. She was determined to fit
out still another expedition, though already over &pound;35,000 had
been spent by private means, mostly from her own personal fortune;
and in 1857 the steam yacht <i>Fox</i> was despatched under M'Clintock,
who had already shown himself the most capable master of sledge
work. He erected a monument to the Franklin expedition on Beechey
Island in 1858, and then following Peel Sound, he made inquiries
of the natives throughout the winter of 1858-59. This led him to
search King William Land, where, on the 25th May, he came across
a bleached human skeleton lying on its face, showing that the man
had died as he walked. Meanwhile, Hobson, one of his companions,
discovered a record of the Franklin expedition, stating briefly its
history between 1845 and 1848; and with this definite information
of the fate of the Franklin expedition M'Clintock returned to England
in 1859, having succeeded in solving the problem of Franklin's fate,
while exploring over 800 miles of coast-line in the neighbourhood
of King William Land.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The result of the various Franklin expeditions had thus been to
map out the intricate
<a name="page 200"><span class="page">Page 200</span></a>
network of islands dotted over the north of North America. None
of these, however, reached much farther north than 75&deg;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Only Smith Sound promised to lead north of the 80th parallel. This
had been discovered as early as 1616 by Baffin, whose farthest
north was only exceeded by forty miles, in 1852, by Inglefield
in the <i>Isabel</i>, one of the ships despatched in search of
Franklin. He was followed up by Kane in the <i>Advance</i>, fitted
out in 1853 by the munificence of two American citizens, Grinnell
and Peabody. Kane worked his way right through Smith Sound and
Robeson Channel into the sea named after him. For two years he
continued investigating Grinnell Land and the adjacent shores of
Greenland. Subsequent investigations by Hayes in 1860, and Hall
ten years later, kept alive the interest in Smith Sound and its
neighbourhood; and in 1873 three ships were despatched under Captain
(afterwards Sir George) Nares, who nearly completed the survey of
Grinnell Land, and one of his lieutenants, Pelham Aldrich, succeeded
in reaching 82.48&deg; N. About the same time, an Austrian expedition
under Payer and Weyprecht explored the highest known land, much
to the east, named by them Franz Josef Land, after the Austrian
Emperor.

NORTH POLAR REGION&mdash;EASTERN HALF.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
Simultaneously interest in the northern regions was aroused by
the successful exploit of the north-east passage by Professor
(afterwards Baron) Nordenskiold, who had made seven or eight voyages
in Arctic regions between
<a name="page 202"><span class="page">Page 202</span></a>
1858 and 1870. He first established the possibility of passing
from Norway to the mouth of the Yenesei in the summer, making two
journeys in 1875-76. These have since been followed up for commercial
purposes by Captain Wiggins, who has frequently passed from England
to the mouth of the Yenesei in a merchant vessel. As Siberia develops
there can be little doubt that this route will become of increasing
commercial importance. Professor Nordenskiold, however, encouraged
by his easy passage to the Yenesei, determined to try to get round
into Behring Strait from that point, and in 1878 he started in
the <i>Vega</i>, accompanied by the <i>Lena</i>, and a collier
to supply them with coal. On the 19th August they passed Cape
Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Old World. From here
the <i>Lena</i> appropriately turned its course to the mouth of its
namesake, while the <i>Vega</i> proceeded on her course, reaching
on the 12th September Cape North, within 120 miles of Behring Strait;
this cape Cook had reached from the east in 1778. Unfortunately the
ice became packed so closely that they could not proceed farther,
and they had to remain in this tantalising condition for no less
than ten months. On the 18th July 1879 the ice broke up, and two
days later the <i>Vega</i> rounded East Cape with flying colours,
saluting the easternmost coast of Asia in honour of the completion
of the north-east passage. Baron Nordenskiold has since enjoyed
a well-earned leisure from his arduous labours in the north
<a name="page 203"><span class="page">Page 203</span></a>
by studying and publishing the history of early cartography, on
which he has issued two valuable atlases, containing fac-similes
of the maps and charts of the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p class="indent">
General interest thus re-aroused in Arctic exploration brought about
a united effort of all the civilised nations to investigate the
conditions of the Polar regions. An international Polar Conference
was held at Hamburg in 1879, at which it was determined to surround
the North Pole for the years 1882-83 by stations of scientific
observation, intended to study the conditions of the Polar Ocean. No
less than fifteen expeditions were sent forth; some to the Antarctic
regions, but most of them round the North Pole. Their object was
more to subserve the interest of physical geography than to promote
the interest of geographical discovery; but one of the expeditions,
that of the United States under Lieutenant A. W. Greely, again took
up the study of Smith Sound and its outlets, and one of his men,
Lieutenant Lockwood, succeeded in reaching 83.24&deg; N., within 450
miles of the Pole, and up to that time the farthest north reached
by any human being. The Greely expedition also succeeded in showing
that Greenland was not so much ice-capped as ice-surrounded.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Hitherto the universal method by which discoveries had been made
in the Polar regions was to establish a base at which sufficient
food was cached, then to push in any required direction as far
as possible, leaving
<a name="page 204"><span class="page">Page 204</span></a>
successive caches to be returned to when provisions fell short on
the forward journey. But in 1888, Dr. Fridjof Nansen determined
on a bolder method of investigating the interior of Greenland. He
was deposited upon the east coast, where there were no inhabitants,
and started to cross Greenland, his life depending upon the success
of his journey, since he left no reserves in the rear and it would
be useless to return. He succeeded brilliantly in his attempt, and
his exploit was followed up by two successive attempts of Lieutenant
Peary in 1892-95, who succeeded in crossing Greenland at much higher
latitude even than Nansen.

<br />
CLIMBING THE NORTH POLE
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
The success of his bold plan encouraged Dr. Nansen to attempt an
even bolder one. He had become convinced, from the investigations
conducted by the international Polar observations of 1882-83, that
there was a continuous drift of the ice across the Arctic Ocean
from the north-east shore of Siberia. He was confirmed in this
opinion, by the fact that debris from the <i>Jeannette</i>, a ship
abandoned in 1881 off the Siberian coast, drifted across to the
east coast of Greenland by 1884. He had a vessel built for him,
the now-renowned <i>Fram</i>, especially intended to resist the
pressure of the ice. Hitherto it had been the chief aim of Arctic
explorations to avoid besetment, and to try and creep round the
land shores. Dr. Nansen was convinced that he could best attain
his ends by boldly disregarding these canons and trusting to the
<a name="page 206"><span class="page">Page 206</span></a>
drift of the ice to carry him near to the Pole. He reckoned that the
drift would take some three years, and provisioned the <i>Fram</i>
for five. The results of his venturous voyage confirmed in almost
every particular his remarkable plan, though it was much scouted
in many quarters when first announced. The drift of the ice carried
him across the Polar Sea within the three years he had fixed upon
for the probable duration of his journey; but finding that the
drift would not carry him far enough north, he left the <i>Fram</i>
with a companion, and advanced straight towards the Pole, reaching
in April 1895 farthest north, 86.14&deg;, within nearly 200 miles of
the Pole. On his return journey he was lucky enough to come across
Mr. F. Jackson, who in the <i>Windward</i> had established himself
in 1894 in Franz Josef Land. The rencontre of the two intrepid
explorers forms an apt parallel of the celebrated encounter of
Stanley and Livingstone, amidst entirely opposite conditions of
climate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nansen's voyage is for the present the final achievement of Arctic
exploration, but his Greenland method of deserting his base has
been followed by Andr&eacute;e, who in the autumn of 1897 started
in a balloon for the Pole, provisioned for a long stay in the Arctic
regions. Nothing has been heard of him for the last twelve months,
but after the example of Dr. Nansen there is no reason to fear
just at present for his safety, and the present year may possibly
see his return after a successful
<a name="page 207"><span class="page">Page 207</span></a>
carrying out of one of the great aims of geographical discovery.
It is curious that the attention of the world should be at the
present moment directed to the Arctic regions for the two most
opposite motives that can be named, lust for gold and the thirst
for knowledge and honour.

Produced by Robert J. Hall.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
